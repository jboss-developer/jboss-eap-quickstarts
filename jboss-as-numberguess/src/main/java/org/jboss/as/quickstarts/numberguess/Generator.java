/**
 * <p>
 * Random number generator.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Placing the random number generation, as well as the configuring the maximum number allows for a
 * more loosely coupled application. We can now change out the implementation of number generation
 * without any effect on the client code. We also produce a more intuitive design - both are
 * identifed by the fact they are numbers (int) and that they are qualified as the maximum number or
 * a random number.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * We use the application scope to store the random number generator so that we use the same seed.
