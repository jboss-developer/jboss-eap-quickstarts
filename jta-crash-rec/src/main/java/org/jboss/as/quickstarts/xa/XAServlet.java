            "<p>Demonstration of how to atomically update a relational database table using JPA and send " +
            "a message using JMS (these kinds of paired updates to two different resources are called " +
            "XA transactions and are defined by the JEE JTA specification). " +
            "</p> " +
            "<p>The relational table contains two columns to represent a key value pair. " +
            "Below is an HTML form containing two input boxes for creating, updating, deleting or listing " +
            "such pairs. " +
            "</p> " +
            "<p>When you add or update a pair the example will start a transaction, update the table, " +
            "produce a JMS message (containing the change) and finally commit the transaction. If all goes well " +
            "then eventually the message is received by a consumer that will then modify the pair (with text that " +
            "indicates it was changed by the message consumer) and update the database. " +
            "The idea is to demonstrate recovery by halting the application server after the database modification " +
            "is committed but before the JMS producer is committed." +

            "<p>The <a href=\"readme.html\">readme instructions</a> that accompany this quickstart will walk you " +
            "through how to generate a failure in between the update to the database and the sending of the  " +
            "message (by halting the application server). After the failure if you use an SQL client to examine " +
            "the table you will see that it contains the pair you added but it will not show the update by the " +
            "JMS consumer since the message is still pending. When you restart the application server the " +
            "transaction recovery system will attempt to resend the message. On receipt by the consumer the " +
            "pair is updated and if you now examine the table this final change will be visible. But note that " +
            "since message consumption is asynchronous you may need to wait a moment before the message is " +
            "delivered to the consumer" +
