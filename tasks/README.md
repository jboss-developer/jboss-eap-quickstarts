tasks: Test JPA with Arquillian
==================================
Author: Oliver Kiss, Lukas Fryc  
Level: Intermediate  
Technologies: JPA, Arquillian  
Summary: The `tasks` quickstart includes a persistence unit and sample persistence code to demonstrates how to use JPA for database access in JBoss EAP.  
Target Product: JBoss EAP  
Source: <https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/>  


What is it?
-----------

The `tasks` quickstart demonstrates how to use JPA in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. 

It includes a persistence unit and some sample persistence code to introduce you database access in enterprise Java. 

It does not contain an user interface layer. The purpose of the project is to show you how to test JPA with Arquillian.

_Note: This quickstart uses the H2 database included with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7. It is a lightweight, relational example datasource that is used for examples only. It is not robust or scalable, is not supported, and should NOT be used in a production environment!_

_Note: This quickstart uses a `*-ds.xml` datasource configuration file for convenience and ease of database configuration. These files are deprecated in JBoss EAP and should not be used in a production environment. Instead, you should configure the datasource using the Management CLI or Management Console. Datasource configuration is documented in the [Administration and Configuration Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/) for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform._


System requirements
-------------------

The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7 or later. 

All you need to build this project is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later, Maven 3.0 or later.

_Note: This quickstart uses the H2 database included with JBoss EAP. It is a lightweight, relational example datasource that is used for examples only. It is not robust or scalable, is not supported, and should NOT be used in a production environment!_
 
Configure Maven
---------------

If you have not yet done so, you must [Configure Maven](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) before testing the quickstarts.


Use of EAP_HOME
---------------

In the following instructions, replace `EAP_HOME` with the actual path to your JBoss EAP installation. The installation path is described in detail here: [Use of EAP_HOME and JBOSS_HOME Variables](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_OF_EAP_HOME.md#use-of-eap_home-and-jboss_home-variables).


Start the JBoss EAP Server
-------------------------

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the JBoss EAP directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server:

        For Linux:   EAP_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows: EAP_HOME\bin\standalone.bat


Run the Arquillian Tests 
-------------------------

This quickstart provides Arquillian tests. By default, these tests are configured to be skipped as Arquillian tests require the use of a container. 

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type the following command to run the test goal with the following profile activated:

        mvn clean test -Parq-jbossas-remote 

Investigate the Console Output
----------------------------

Maven prints summary of the 8 performed tests to the console.

### Server log

SQL statements generated by Hibernate are written into the server log.

#### Server Log: Expected warnings and errors

_Note:_ You will see the following warnings in the server log. You can ignore these warnings.

    JBAS010489: -ds.xml file deployments are deprecated. Support may be removed in a future version.

    HHH000431: Unable to determine H2 database version, certain features may not work


#### Example Output from the tests

Creating the database schema:

    10:16:58,770 INFO  [stdout] (MSC service thread 1-2) Hibernate: create table Tasks_task (id bigint not null, title varchar(255), owner_id bigint, primary key (id))
    10:16:58,771 INFO  [stdout] (MSC service thread 1-2) Hibernate: create table Tasks_user (id bigint not null, username varchar(255), primary key (id))
    10:16:58,772 INFO  [stdout] (MSC service thread 1-2) Hibernate: alter table Tasks_task add constraint FKE61757B62CC79EF1 foreign key (owner_id) references Tasks_user

Generating ID for a new entity and inserting the entity into the database:

    10:16:58,956 INFO  [stdout] (http--127.0.0.1-8080-1) Hibernate: select tbl.next_val from hibernate_sequences tbl where tbl.sequence_name=? for update
    10:16:58,957 INFO  [stdout] (http--127.0.0.1-8080-1) Hibernate: insert into hibernate_sequences (sequence_name, next_val)  values (?,?)
    10:16:58,958 INFO  [stdout] (http--127.0.0.1-8080-1) Hibernate: update hibernate_sequences set next_val=?  where next_val=? and sequence_name=?
    10:16:58,960 INFO  [stdout] (http--127.0.0.1-8080-1) Hibernate: insert into Tasks_user (username, id) values (?, ?)


Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse
-------------------------------------
You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a JBoss EAP server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see [Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_JBDS.md#use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts) 


Debug the Application
------------------------------------

If you want to debug the source code of any library in the project, run the following command to pull the source into your local repository. The IDE should then detect it.

        mvn dependency:sources
