helloworld-mdb: Helloworld Using an MDB (Message-Driven Bean)
============================================================
Author: Serge Pagop, Andy Taylor, Jeff Mesnil  
Level: Intermediate  
Technologies: JMS, EJB, MDB  
Summary: The `helloworld-mdb` quickstart uses *JMS 1.1* and *EJB 3.1 Message-Driven Bean* (MDB) to create and deploy JMS topic and queue resources in JBoss EAP.  
Target Product: JBoss EAP  
Source: <https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/>  

What is it?
-----------

The `helloworld-mdb` quickstart demonstrates the use of *JMS 1.1* and *EJB 3.1 Message-Driven Bean* in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.

This project creates two JMS resources:

* A queue named `HELLOWORLDMDBQueue` bound in JNDI as `java:/queue/HELLOWORLDMDBQueue`
* A topic named `HELLOWORLDMDBTopic` bound in JNDI as `java:/topic/HELLOWORLDMDBTopic`


System requirements
-------------------

The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1 or later. 

All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or later, Maven 3.0 or later.

 
Configure Maven
---------------

If you have not yet done so, you must [Configure Maven](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) before testing the quickstarts.


Use of EAP_HOME
---------------

In the following instructions, replace `EAP_HOME` with the actual path to your JBoss EAP 6 installation. The installation path is described in detail here: [Use of EAP_HOME and JBOSS_HOME Variables](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_OF_EAP_HOME.md#use-of-eap_home-and-jboss_home-variables).


Start the JBoss EAP Server with the Full Profile
---------------

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the JBoss EAP directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server with the full profile:

        For Linux:   EAP_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
        For Windows: EAP_HOME\bin\standalone.bat -c standalone-full.xml


Build and Deploy the Quickstart
-------------------------

_NOTE: The following build command assumes you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line. See [Build and Deploy the Quickstarts](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/BUILD_AND_DEPLOY.md#build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) for complete instructions and additional options._

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:

        mvn clean install jboss-as:deploy

4. This will deploy `target/jboss-helloworld-mdb.war` to the running instance of the server. Look at the JBoss EAP console or Server log and you should see log messages corresponding to the deployment of the message-driven beans and the JMS destinations:

        14:11:01,020 INFO org.hornetq.core.server.impl.HornetQServerImpl trying to deploy queue jms.queue.HELLOWORLDMDBQueue
        14:11:01,029 INFO org.jboss.as.messaging JBAS011601: Bound messaging object to jndi name java:/queue/HELLOWORLDMDBQueue
        14:11:01,030 INFO org.hornetq.core.server.impl.HornetQServerImpl trying to deploy queue jms.topic.HELLOWORLDMDBTopic
        14:11:01,060 INFO org.jboss.as.ejb3 JBAS014142: Started message driven bean 'HelloWorldQueueMDB' with 'hornetq-ra' resource adapter
        14:11:01,060 INFO org.jboss.as.ejb3 JBAS014142: Started message driven bean 'HelloWorldQTopicMDB' with 'hornetq-ra' resource adapter
        14:11:01,070 INFO org.jboss.as.messaging JBAS011601: Bound messaging object to jndi name java:/topic/HELLOWORLDMDBTopic

Access the application 
---------------------

The application will be running at the following URL: <http://localhost:8080/jboss-helloworld-mdb/> and will send some messages to the queue.

To send messages to the topic, use the following URL: <http://localhost:8080/jboss-helloworld-mdb/HelloWorldMDBServletClient?topic>

Investigate the Server Console Output
-------------------------

Look at the JBoss EAP console or Server log and you should see log messages like the following:

    17:51:52,122 INFO  [class org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb.HelloWorldQueueMDB] (Thread-1 (HornetQ-client-global-threads-26912020)) Received Message from queue: This is message 1
    17:51:52,123 INFO  [class org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb.HelloWorldQueueMDB] (Thread-11 (HornetQ-client-global-threads-26912020)) Received Message from queue: This is message 2
    17:51:52,124 INFO  [class org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb.HelloWorldQueueMDB] (Thread-12 (HornetQ-client-global-threads-26912020)) Received Message from queue: This is message 5
    17:51:52,135 INFO  [class org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb.HelloWorldQueueMDB] (Thread-13 (HornetQ-client-global-threads-26912020)) Received Message from queue: This is message 4
    17:51:52,136 INFO  [class org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb.HelloWorldQueueMDB] (Thread-14 (HornetQ-client-global-threads-26912020)) Received Message from queue: This is message 3


Undeploy the Archive
--------------------

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:

        mvn jboss-as:undeploy


Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse
-------------------------------------
You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a JBoss EAP server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see [Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_JBDS.md#use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts) 

_NOTE:_ Within JBoss Developer Studio, be sure to define a server runtime environment that uses the `standalone-full.xml` configuration file.


Debug the Application
------------------------------------

If you want to debug the source code of any library in the project, run the following command to pull the source into your local repository. The IDE should then detect it.

    mvn dependency:sources
   


Build and Deploy the Quickstart - to OpenShift
-------------------------

### Create an OpenShift Account and Domain

If you do not yet have an OpenShift account and domain, [Sign in to OpenShift](https://openshift.redhat.com/app/login) to create the account and domain. [Get Started with OpenShift](https://openshift.redhat.com/app/getting_started) will show you how to install the OpenShift Express command line interface.

### Create the OpenShift Application

_NOTE_: The domain name for this application will be `helloworldmdb-YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME.rhcloud.com`. In these instructions, be sure to replace all instances of `YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME` with your own OpenShift account user name.

Open a shell command prompt and change to a directory of your choice. Enter the following command to create a JBoss EAP 6 application:

        rhc app create -a helloworldmdb -t jbosseap-6

This command creates an OpenShift application called `helloworldmdb` and will run the application inside the `jbosseap-6`. You should see some output similar to the following:

    Application Options
    -------------------
      Namespace:  YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME
      Cartridges: jbosseap-6 (addtl. costs may apply)
      Gear Size:  default
      Scaling:    no

    Creating application 'helloworldmdb' ... done

    Waiting for your DNS name to be available ... done

    Cloning into 'helloworldmdb'...
    Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '54.237.58.0' to the list of known hosts.

    Your application 'helloworldmdb' is now available.

      URL:        http://helloworldmdb-YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME.rhcloud.com/
      SSH to:     52864af85973ca430200006f@helloworldmdb-YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME.rhcloud.com
      Git remote: ssh://52864af85973ca430200006f@helloworldmdb-YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME.rhcloud.com/~/git/helloworldmdb.git/
      Cloned to:  CURRENT_DIRECTORY/helloworldmdb

    Run 'rhc show-app helloworldmdb' for more details about your app.

The create command creates a git repository in the current directory with the same name as the application, in this case, `helloworldmdb`. Notice that the output also reports the URL at which the application can be accessed. Make sure it is available by typing the published url <http://helloworldmdb-YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME.rhcloud.com/> into a browser or use command line tools such as curl or wget. Be sure to replace `YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME` with your OpenShift account domain name.
        

### Migrate the Quickstart Source

Now that you have confirmed it is working you can migrate the quickstart source. You do not need the generated default application, so navigate to the new git repository directory and tell git to remove the source and pom files:

    cd helloworldmdb
    git rm -r src pom.xml

Copy the source for the `helloworld-mdb` quickstart into this new git repository:

    cp -r QUICKSTART_HOME/helloworld-mdb/src .
    cp QUICKSTART_HOME/helloworld-mdb/pom.xml .
    
### Configure the OpenShift Server

HornetQ is enabled by default in `.openshift/config/standalone.xml`. There is nothing to do to be able to send and receive messages from OpenShift.

### Deploy the OpenShift Application

You can now deploy the changes to your OpenShift application using git as follows:

    git add src pom.xml
    git commit -m "helloworld-mdb quickstart on OpenShift"
    git push

The final push command triggers the OpenShift infrastructure to build and deploy the changes. 

Note that the `openshift` profile in the `pom.xml` file is activated by OpenShift. This causes the WAR built by OpenShift to be copied to the `deployments/` directory and deployed without a context path.

### Test the OpenShift Application

When the push command returns you can test the application by getting the following URL either via a browser or using tools such as curl or wget. Be sure to replace the `YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME` in the URL with your OpenShift account domain name.

* <http://helloworldmdb-YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME.rhcloud.com/HelloWorldMDBServletClient> to send messages to the queue
* <http://helloworldmdb-YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME.rhcloud.com/HelloWorldMDBServletClient?topic> to send messages to the topic

If the application has run succesfully you should see some output in the browser.

You can use the OpenShift command line tools or the OpenShift web console to discover and control the application.


### View the JBoss EAP Server Log on OpenShift

Now you can look at the output of the server by running the following command:

    rhc tail -a helloworldmdb

This will show the tail of the JBoss EAP server log, which should show something like the following.

    2012/03/02 05:52:33,065 INFO  [class org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb.HelloWorldMDB] (Thread-0 (HornetQ-client-global-threads-1772719)) Received Message from queue: This is message 4
    2012/03/02 05:52:33,065 INFO  [class org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb.HelloWorldMDB] (Thread-1 (HornetQ-client-global-threads-1772719)) Received Message from queue: This is message 1
    2012/03/02 05:52:33,067 INFO  [class org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb.HelloWorldMDB] (Thread-6 (HornetQ-client-global-threads-1772719)) Received Message from queue: This is message 5
    2012/03/02 05:52:33,065 INFO  [class org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb.HelloWorldMDB] (Thread-3 (HornetQ-client-global-threads-1772719)) Received Message from queue: This is message 3
    2012/03/02 05:52:33,065 INFO  [class org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb.HelloWorldMDB] (Thread-2 (HornetQ-client-global-threads-1772719)) Received Message from queue: This is message 2

_Note:_ You may see the following error in the log:

        2014/03/17 07:50:36,231 ERROR [org.jboss.as.controller.management-operation] (management-handler-thread - 4) JBAS014613: Operation ("read-resource") failed - address: ([("subsystem" => "deployment-scanner")]) - failure description: "JBAS014807: Management resource '[(\"subsystem\" => \"deployment-scanner\")]' not found"

This is a benign error that occurs when the status of the deployment is checked too early in the process. This process is retried, so you can safely ignore this error.

### Delete the OpenShift Application

When you are finished with the application you can delete it from OpenShift it as follows:

        rhc app-delete -a helloworldmdb
        
_Note_: There is a limit to the number of applications you can deploy concurrently to OpenShift. If the `rhc app create` command returns an error indicating you have reached that limit, you must delete an existing application before you continue. 

* To view the list of your OpenShift applications, type: `rhc domain show`
* To delete an application from OpenShift, type the following, substituting the application name you want to delete: `rhc app-delete -a APPLICATION_NAME_TO_DELETE`
