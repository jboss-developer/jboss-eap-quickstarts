/**
 * The Batch 1.0 race stage, which starts a job execution and waits for it to complete.
 *
 * Apps deploy Batch jobs by packaging the related XML descriptors in META-INF/batch-jobs. The name of these Batch jobs, which is needed to start their execution, is the name of the XML file, without the ".xml".
 * This app deploys a Batch job named "race", so the XML descriptor file is named "race.xml" and put in "src/main/resources/META-INF/batch-jobs" directory of the project.
