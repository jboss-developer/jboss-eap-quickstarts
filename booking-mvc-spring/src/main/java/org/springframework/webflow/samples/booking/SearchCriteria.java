 * A backing bean for the main hotel search form. Encapsulates the criteria needed to perform a hotel search.

 * references to transient services that are restored automatically when the flow is resumed on subsequent requests.
 * This would allow this SearchCriteria object to delegate to the {@link BookingService} directly, for example,
 * eliminating the need for the actions in {@link MainActions}.
