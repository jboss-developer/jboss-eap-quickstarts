Summary: EJB that demonstrates container-managed transactions (CMT)<br/>
Target Product: EAP<br/>
Product Versions: EAP 6.1, EAP 6.2<br/>

<h2><a id="what-is-it" class="anchor" href="#what-is-it"><span class="anchor-icon"></span></a>What is it?</h2>

<p>This quickstart demonstrates using transactions managed by the container. It is a fairly typical scenario of updating a database and sending a JMS message in the same transaction. A simple MDB is provided that prints out the message sent but this is not a transactional MDB and is purely provided for debugging purposes.</p>

<p>Aspects touched upon in the code:</p>

<ol>
<li>XA transaction control using the container managed transaction annotations</li>
<li>XA access to a PostgreSQL database using the JPA API</li>
<li>XA access to a JMS queue</li>
</ol>

<p>After users complete this quickstart, they are invited to run through the following quickstarts:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>jts</em> - The JTS quickstart builds upon this quickstart by distributing the CustomerManager and InvoiceManager</li>
<li><em>jts-distributed-crash-rec</em> - The crash recovery quickstart builds upon the <em>jts</em> quickstart by demonstrating the fault tolerance of JBossAS</li>
</ol>

<h3><a id="what-are-container-managed-transactions" class="anchor" href="#what-are-container-managed-transactions"><span class="anchor-icon"></span></a>What are container managed transactions?</h3>

<p>Prior to EJB, getting the right incantation to ensure sound transactional operation of the business logic was a highly specialised skill. Although this still holds true to a great extent, EJB has provided a series of improvements to to allow simplified transaction demarcation notation that is therefore easier to read and test. </p>

<p>With CMT, the EJB container sets the boundaries of a transaction. This differs from BMT (bean managed transactions) where the developer is responsible for initiating and completing a transaction via the methods begin, commit, rollback on a <code>javax.transaction.UserTransaction</code>.</p>

<h3><a id="what-makes-this-an-example-of-container-managed-transactions" class="anchor" href="#what-makes-this-an-example-of-container-managed-transactions"><span class="anchor-icon"></span></a>What makes this an example of container managed transactions?</h3>

<p>Take a look at <code>org.jboss.as.quickstarts.cmt.ejb.CustomerManagerEJBImpl</code>. You can see that this stateless session bean has been marked up with the @javax.ejb.TransactionAttribute annotation.</p>

<p>The available options for this annotation are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Required - As demonstrated in the quickstart. If a transaction does not already exist, this will initiate a transaction and complete it for you, otherwise the business logic will be integrated into the existing transaction</li>
<li>RequiresNew - If there is already a transaction running, it will be suspended, the work performed within a new transaction which is completed at exit of the method and then the original transaction resumed. </li>
<li>Mandatory - If there is no transaction running, calling a business method with is annotated with this will result in an error</li>
<li>NotSupported - If there is a transaction running, it will be suspended and no transaction will be initiated for this business method</li>
<li>Supports - This will run the method within a transaction if a transaction exists, alternatively, if there is no transaction running the method will not be executed within the scope of a transaction </li>
<li>Never - If the client has a transaction running and does not suspend it but calls a method annotated with Never then an EJB exception will be raised.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="system-requirements" class="anchor" href="#system-requirements"><span class="anchor-icon"></span></a>System requirements</h2>

<p>The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1 or later. </p>

<p>All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or later, Maven 3.0 or later.</p>

<p><em>Note: This quickstart uses the H2 database included with JBoss EAP 6. It is a lightweight, relational example datasource that is used for examples only. It is not robust or scalable and should NOT be used in a production environment!</em></p>

<h2><a id="configure-maven" class="anchor" href="#configure-maven"><span class="anchor-icon"></span></a>Configure Maven</h2>

<p>If you have not yet done so, you must <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts">Configure Maven</a> before testing the quickstarts.</p>

<p>This quickstart requires the PostgreSQL database. Instructions to install and configure PostgreSQL can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_POSTGRESQL.md#configure-the-postgresql-database-for-use-with-the-quickstarts">Configure the PostgreSQL Database for Use with the Quickstarts</a></p>

<p><em>Note</em>: For the purpose of this quickstart, replace the word <code>QUICKSTART_DATABASE_NAME</code> with <code>cmt-quickstart-database</code> in the PostgreSQL instructions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Be sure to start the PostgreSQL database. Unless you have set up the database to automatically start as a service, you must repeat the instructions &ldquo;Start the database server&rdquo; for your operating system every time you reboot your machine.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions to <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_POSTGRESQL.md#add-the-postgresql-module-to-the-jboss-eap-server">Add the PostgreSQL Module to the JBoss EAP Server</a>.</li>

<p>The application will be running at the following URL: <a href="http://localhost:8080/jboss-cmt/">http://localhost:8080/jboss-cmt/</a>.</p>

<p>You will be presented with a simple form for adding customers to a database.</p>

<p>After a user is successfully added to the database, a message is produced containing the details of the user. An example MDB will dequeue this message and print the following contents:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">Received</span> <span class="n">Message</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Created</span> <span class="n">invoice</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">customer</span> <span class="n">named</span><span class="o">:</span>  <span class="n">Tom</span>
</pre></div>
<p>When the same customer name is given, a duplicate warning is given and no JMS-message is send to cause the above message.</p>

<p>The customer name should match: letter &amp; &lsquo;-&rsquo;, else an error is given. This is to show that a &lsquo;LogMessage&rsquo; entity is still stored in the database thanks to the <code>@TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRES_NEW)</code>
that the method logCreateCustomer in the EJB LogMessageManagerEJB is decorated with. </p>
