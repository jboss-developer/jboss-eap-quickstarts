Summary: EJB that demonstrates container-managed transactions (CMT)<br/>
Target Product: EAP<br/>
Product Versions: EAP 6.1, EAP 6.2<br/>

<h2><a id="what-is-it" class="anchor" href="#what-is-it"><span class="anchor-icon"></span></a>What is it?</h2>

<p>This quickstart demonstrates using transactions managed by the container. It is a fairly typical scenario of updating a database and sending a JMS message in the same transaction. A simple MDB is provided that prints out the message sent but this is not a transactional MDB and is purely provided for debugging purposes.</p>

<p>Aspects touched upon in the code:</p>

<ol>
<li>XA transaction control using the container managed transaction annotations</li>
<li>XA access to a PostgreSQL database using the JPA API</li>
<li>XA access to a JMS queue</li>
</ol>

<p>After users complete this quickstart, they are invited to run through the following quickstarts:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>jts</em> - The JTS quickstart builds upon this quickstart by distributing the CustomerManager and InvoiceManager</li>
<li><em>jts-distributed-crash-rec</em> - The crash recovery quickstart builds upon the <em>jts</em> quickstart by demonstrating the fault tolerance of JBossAS</li>
</ol>

<h3><a id="what-are-container-managed-transactions" class="anchor" href="#what-are-container-managed-transactions"><span class="anchor-icon"></span></a>What are container managed transactions?</h3>

<p>Prior to EJB, getting the right incantation to ensure sound transactional operation of the business logic was a highly specialised skill. Although this still holds true to a great extent, EJB has provided a series of improvements to to allow simplified transaction demarcation notation that is therefore easier to read and test. </p>

<p>With CMT, the EJB container sets the boundaries of a transaction. This differs from BMT (bean managed transactions) where the developer is responsible for initiating and completing a transaction via the methods begin, commit, rollback on a <code>javax.transaction.UserTransaction</code>.</p>

<h3><a id="what-makes-this-an-example-of-container-managed-transactions" class="anchor" href="#what-makes-this-an-example-of-container-managed-transactions"><span class="anchor-icon"></span></a>What makes this an example of container managed transactions?</h3>

<p>Take a look at <code>org.jboss.as.quickstarts.cmt.ejb.CustomerManagerEJBImpl</code>. You can see that this stateless session bean has been marked up with the @javax.ejb.TransactionAttribute annotation.</p>

<p>The available options for this annotation are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Required - As demonstrated in the quickstart. If a transaction does not already exist, this will initiate a transaction and complete it for you, otherwise the business logic will be integrated into the existing transaction</li>
<li>RequiresNew - If there is already a transaction running, it will be suspended, the work performed within a new transaction which is completed at exit of the method and then the original transaction resumed. </li>
<li>Mandatory - If there is no transaction running, calling a business method with is annotated with this will result in an error</li>
<li>NotSupported - If there is a transaction running, it will be suspended and no transaction will be initiated for this business method</li>
<li>Supports - This will run the method within a transaction if a transaction exists, alternatively, if there is no transaction running the method will not be executed within the scope of a transaction </li>
<li>Never - If the client has a transaction running and does not suspend it but calls a method annotated with Never then an EJB exception will be raised.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="system-requirements" class="anchor" href="#system-requirements"><span class="anchor-icon"></span></a>System requirements</h2>

<p>The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1 or later. </p>

<p>All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or later, Maven 3.0 or later.</p>

<p><em>Note: This quickstart uses the H2 database included with JBoss EAP 6. It is a lightweight, relational example datasource that is used for examples only. It is not robust or scalable and should NOT be used in a production environment!</em></p>

<h2><a id="configure-maven" class="anchor" href="#configure-maven"><span class="anchor-icon"></span></a>Configure Maven</h2>

<p>If you have not yet done so, you must <a href="../README.html#configure-maven">Configure Maven</a> before testing the quickstarts.</p>

<p>This quickstart requires the PostgreSQL database. Instructions to install an configure PostgreSQL can be found here: <a href="../README.html#install-and-configure-the-postgresql-database">Install and Configure the PostgreSQL Database</a></p>

<p><em>Note</em>: For the purpose of this quickstart, replace the word QUICKSTART_DATABASENAME with <code>cmt-quickstart-database</code> in the PostgreSQL instructions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Be sure to start the PostgreSQL database. Unless you have set up the database to automatically start as a service, you must repeat the instructions &ldquo;Start the database server&rdquo; for your operating system every time you reboot your machine.</li>
