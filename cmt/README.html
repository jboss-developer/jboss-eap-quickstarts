Summary: The <code>cmt</code> quickstart demonstrates Container-Managed Transactions (CMT), showing how to use transactions managed by the container.<br/>
Target Product: JBoss EAP<br/>
Source: <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/">https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/</a>  </p>

<h2><a id="what-is-it" class="anchor" href="#what-is-it"><span class="anchor-icon"></span></a>What is it?</h2>

<p>The <code>cmt</code> quickstart demonstrates using transactions managed by the container in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. It is a fairly typical scenario of updating a database and sending a JMS message in the same transaction. A simple MDB is provided that prints out the message sent but this is not a transactional MDB and is purely provided for debugging purposes.</p>

<p>Aspects touched upon in the code:</p>

<ol>
<li>XA transaction control using the container managed transaction annotations</li>
<li>XA access to the standard default datasource using the JPA API</li>
<li>XA access to a JMS queue</li>
</ol>

<p>After users complete this quickstart, they are invited to run through the following quickstarts:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="../jts/README.html">jts</a> - The JTS quickstart builds upon this quickstart by distributing the CustomerManager and InvoiceManager</li>
<li><a href="../jts-distributed-crash-rec/README.html">jts-distributed-crash-rec</a> - The crash recovery quickstart builds upon the <a href="../jts/README.html">jts</a> quickstart by demonstrating the fault tolerance of JBoss EAP.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Note: This quickstart uses the H2 database included with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7. It is a lightweight, relational example datasource that is used for examples only. It is not robust or scalable, is not supported, and should NOT be used in a production environment!</em></p>

<h3><a id="what-are-container-managed-transactions" class="anchor" href="#what-are-container-managed-transactions"><span class="anchor-icon"></span></a>What are container managed transactions?</h3>

<p>Prior to EJB, getting the right incantation to ensure sound transactional operation of the business logic was a highly specialised skill. Although this still holds true to a great extent, EJB has provided a series of improvements to allow simplified transaction demarcation notation that is therefore easier to read and test. </p>

<p>With CMT, the EJB container sets the boundaries of a transaction. This differs from BMT (bean managed transactions) where the developer is responsible for initiating and completing a transaction via the methods begin, commit, rollback on a <code>javax.transaction.UserTransaction</code>.</p>

<h3><a id="what-makes-this-an-example-of-container-managed-transactions" class="anchor" href="#what-makes-this-an-example-of-container-managed-transactions"><span class="anchor-icon"></span></a>What makes this an example of container managed transactions?</h3>

<p>Take a look at <code>org.jboss.as.quickstarts.cmt.ejb.CustomerManagerEJB</code>. You can see that this stateless session bean has been marked up with the @javax.ejb.TransactionAttribute annotation.</p>

<p>The available options for this annotation are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Required - As demonstrated in the quickstart. If a transaction does not already exist, this will initiate a transaction and complete it for you, otherwise the business logic will be integrated into the existing transaction</li>
<li>RequiresNew - If there is already a transaction running, it will be suspended, the work performed within a new transaction which is completed at exit of the method and then the original transaction resumed. </li>
<li>Mandatory - If there is no transaction running, calling a business method with this annotation will result in an error</li>
<li>NotSupported - If there is a transaction running, it will be suspended and no transaction will be initiated for this business method</li>
<li>Supports - This will run the method within a transaction if a transaction exists, alternatively, if there is no transaction running, the method will not be executed within the scope of a transaction </li>
<li>Never - If the client has a transaction running and does not suspend it but calls a method annotated with Never then an EJB exception will be raised.</li>
</ul>

<p>The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7 or later. </p>

<p>All you need to build this project is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later and Maven 3.1.1 or later. See <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN_JBOSS_EAP7.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts">Configure Maven for JBoss EAP 7</a> to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.</p>

<h2><a id="use-of-eap7home" class="anchor" href="#use-of-eap7home"><span class="anchor-icon"></span></a>Use of EAP7_HOME</h2>

<p>In the following instructions, replace <code>EAP7_HOME</code> with the actual path to your JBoss EAP installation. The installation path is described in detail here: <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_OF_EAP7_HOME.md#use-of-eap_home-and-jboss_home-variables">Use of EAP7_HOME and JBOSS_HOME Variables</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="start-the-jboss-eap-server-with-the-full-profile" class="anchor" href="#start-the-jboss-eap-server-with-the-full-profile"><span class="anchor-icon"></span></a>Start the JBoss EAP Server with the Full Profile</h2>

<ol>
<li>Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the JBoss EAP directory.</li>
<li><p>The following shows the command line to start the server with the full profile:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">For</span> <span class="n">Linux</span><span class="o">:</span>   <span class="n">EAP7_HOME</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">bin</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">standalone</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">sh</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="n">standalone</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">full</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">xml</span>

</ol>

<h2><a id="build-and-deploy-the-quickstart" class="anchor" href="#build-and-deploy-the-quickstart"><span class="anchor-icon"></span></a>Build and Deploy the Quickstart</h2>

<ol>
<li>Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.</li>
<li><p>Type this command to build and deploy the archive:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">clean</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">wildfly</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">deploy</span>
</pre></div></li>
<li><p>This will deploy <code>target/jboss-cmt.war</code> to the running instance of the server.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2><a id="access-the-application-" class="anchor" href="#access-the-application-"><span class="anchor-icon"></span></a>Access the application </h2>

<p>The application will be running at the following URL: <a href="http://localhost:8080/jboss-cmt/">http://localhost:8080/jboss-cmt/</a>.</p>

<p>You will be presented with a simple form for adding customers to a database.</p>

<p>After a user is successfully added to the database, a message is produced containing the details of the user. An example MDB will dequeue this message and print the following contents:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">Received</span> <span class="n">Message</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Created</span> <span class="n">invoice</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">customer</span> <span class="n">named</span><span class="o">:</span>  <span class="n">Jack</span>
</pre></div>
<p>When the same customer name is given, a duplicate warning is given and no JMS-message is send to cause the above message.</p>

<p>The customer name should match: letter &amp; &lsquo;-&rsquo;, otherwise an error is given. This is to show that a &lsquo;LogMessage&rsquo; entity is still stored in the database thanks to the <code>@TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRES_NEW)</code>
that the method logCreateCustomer in the EJB LogMessageManagerEJB is decorated with. </p>
