<h1>cdi-injection: Example Using CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection)</h1>
<p>Author: Jason Porter</p>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>This example demonstrates the use of <em>CDI 1.0 Injection and Qualifiers</em> in <em>JBoss AS 7</em>  or <em>JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6</em> 
with JSF as the front-end client.</p>
<p>You can test the output at the URL http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-cdi-injection</p>
<h2>System requirements</h2>
<p>All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or better, Maven
3.0 or better.</p>
<p>The application this project produces is designed to be run on a JBoss AS 7.</p>
<p>With the prerequisites out of the way, you're ready to build and deploy.</p>
<h2>Deploying the Application</h2>
<p>First you need to start JBoss AS 7 or JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6. To do this, run</p>
<pre><code>$JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
</code></pre>
<p>or if you are using windows</p>
<pre><code>$JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.bat
</code></pre>
<p>To deploy the application, you first need to produce the archive to deploy using
the following Maven goal:</p>
<pre><code>mvn clean package
</code></pre>
<p>You can now deploy the artifact to JBoss AS by executing the following command:</p>
<pre><code>mvn jboss-as:deploy
</code></pre>
<p>This will deploy <code>target/jboss-as-cdi-injection.war</code>.</p>
<p>The application will be running at the following URL <a href="http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-cdi-injection/">http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-cdi-injection/</a>.</p>
<p>To undeploy from JBoss AS, run this command:</p>
<pre><code>mvn jboss-as:undeploy
</code></pre>
<p>You can also start JBoss AS 7 and deploy the project using Eclipse. See the JBoss AS 7
