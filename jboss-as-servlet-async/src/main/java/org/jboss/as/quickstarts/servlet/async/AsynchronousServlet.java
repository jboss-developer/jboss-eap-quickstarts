/**
 * <p>
 * A simple asynchronous servlet taking advantage of features added in 3.0.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The servlet is registered and mapped to /AsynchronousServlet using the {@link WebServlet} annotation. The
 * {@link LongRunningService} is injected by CDI.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * It shows how to detach the execution of a long-running task from the request processing thread, so the thread is free
 * to serve other client requests. The long-running tasks are executed using a dedicated thread pool and create the
 * client response asynchronously using the {@link AsyncContext}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A long-running task in this context does not refer to a computation intensive task executed on the same machine but
 * could for example be contacting a third-party service that has limited resources or only allows for a limited number
 * of concurrent connections. Moving the calls to this service into a separate and smaller sized thread pool ensures
 * that less threads will be busy interacting with the long-running service and that more requests can be served that do
 * not depend on this service.
 * </p>
