What is it?
-----------

CarMart is a simple web application that uses Infinispan Cache instead of a relational database.

Users can list cars, add new cars, or remove them from the CarMart. Information about each car is stored in a cache. The application also shows cache statistics like stores, hits, retrievals, and more.

The CarMart quickstart can work in two modes: 

* _Library mode_  - In this mode, the application and the data grid are running in the same JVM. All libraries (JAR files) are bundled with the application and deployed to JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7.  The library usage mode only allows local access to a single node in a distributed cluster. This usage mode gives the application access to data grid functionality within a virtual machine in the container being used. 

* _Client-server mode_ - In this mode, the Cache is stored in  a managed, distributed and clusterable data grid server.  Applications can remotely access the data grid server using Hot Rod, memcached or REST client APIs. This web application bundles only the HotRod client and communicates with a remote JBoss Data Grid (JDG) server. The JDG server is configured via the `standalone.xml` configuration file.


System requirements
-------------------

All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or better, Maven 3.0 or better.

The application this project produces is designed to be run on JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7. 

 
Configure Maven
---------------

If you have not yet done so, you must [Configure Maven](../README.md#configure-maven) before testing the quickstarts.


Start JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Open a command line and navigate to the root of the JBoss server directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server with the web profile:

        For Linux:   JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows: JBOSS_HOME\bin\standalone.bat


Build and Deploy the Application in Library Mode
-----------------------------------------------

_NOTE: The following build command assumes you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line. See [Build and Deploy the Quickstarts](../README.md#build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) for complete instructions and additional options._

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss Server as described above.
2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:

        mvn clean package jboss-as:deploy
        
4. This will deploy `target/jboss-as-carmart.war` to the running instance of the server.
 

Access the application
---------------------

The application will be running at the following URL: <http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-carmart/>


Undeploy the Archive
--------------------

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss Server as described above.
2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:

        mvn jboss-as:undeploy


Debug the Application
------------------------------------

If you want to debug the source code or look at the Javadocs of any library in the project, run either of the following commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect them.

        mvn dependency:sources
        mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc


Build and Start the Application in Client-server Mode (using the HotRod client)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The application must be deployed to JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7. It can not be deployed to JDG since it does not support deployment of applications. 

1. Obtain the JDG server distribution. See the following for more information: <http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/data-grid/>

2. Configure the remote datagrid in the `$JDG_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file. Copy the following XML into the Infinispan subsystem before the ending </cache-container> tag. If you have an existing `carcache` element, be sure to replace it with this one.
       
            <local-cache name="carcache" start="EAGER" batching="false" indexing="NONE">
                <locking isolation="REPEATABLE_READ" striping="false" acquire-timeout="20000" concurrency-level="500"/>
                <eviction strategy="LIRS" max-entries="4"/>
            </local-cache>
   
3. Start the JDG server using on localhost 100 on port offset: 
    
        $JDG_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100

4. Start JBoss AS 7 into which you want to deploy your application

        $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh

5. The application finds the JDG server using the values in the src/main/resources/META-INF/JDG.properties file. If you are not running the JDG server on the default host and port, you must modify this file to contain the correct values. If you need to change the JDG address:port information, edit src/main/resources/META-INF/JDG.properties file and specify address and port of the JDG server

        datagrid.host=localhost
        datagrid.hotrod.port=11322

6. Build the application in the example's directory:

        mvn clean package -Premote

7. Deploy the application

        mvn jboss-as:deploy -Premote

8. The application will be running at the following URL: <http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-carmart/>

9. Undeploy the application

        mvn jboss-as:undeploy -Premote
