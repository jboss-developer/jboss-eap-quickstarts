    	  <h2>What is it?</h2>
    	  <p>
    	      The <i>ejb-security-interceptors</i> quickstart demonstrates demonstrates how 
    	      to use client and server side interceptors to switch the identity for an EJB 
    	      call in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.

        <h2>Access the Application</h2>
        <p>
            This example application is not intended to be opened in a browser.
            Instead, you execute the client using the <i>mvn exec:exec</i> command.
        </p>
	
        <h2>Additional Information</h2>

            Additional information can be found in the README file at the root of this quickstart directory.
