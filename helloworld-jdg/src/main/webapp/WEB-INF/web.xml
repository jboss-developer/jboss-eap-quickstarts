    Some browsers cookies are stored using host + context combination. Since it doesn't consider the port,
    both applications running on the same host (localhost) and even using different ports (8080 and 8180) can share
    the same JSESSIONID. To permit this quickstart to run on same host and have different JSESSIONID each one,
    we need to use client state saving. We could have the same effect if we used different name for applications
    on each server. Ignoring this setting might result in javax.faces.application.ViewExpiredException
