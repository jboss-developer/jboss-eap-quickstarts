/**
 * An adapter class that exposes the SetManager as a WS-BA participant using the 'Coordinator Completion' protocol.
 * <p/>
 * The Set Service can be invoked multiple times to add many items to the set within a single BA. The service waits for the
 * coordinator to tell it to complete. This has the advantage that the client can continue calling methods on the service right
 * up until it calls 'close'. However, any resources held by the service need to be held for this duration, unless the service
 * decides to autonomously cancel the BA.
