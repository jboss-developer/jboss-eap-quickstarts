hibernate4: How to Use Hibernate 4 in an Application
====================================================
Author: Madhumita Sadhukhan  
Level: Intermediate  
Technologies: Hibernate 4  
Summary: The `hibernate4` quickstart demonstrates how to use Hibernate ORM 4 over JPA 2.0, using Hibernate-Core and Hibernate Bean Validation, and EJB 3.1.  
Target Product: JBoss EAP  
Source: <https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/>  

What is it?
-----------

The `hibernate4` quickstart is based upon the [kitchensink](../kitchensink/README.md) example, but demonstrates how to use Hibernate Object/Relational Mapping (ORM) 4 over JPA 2.0 in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.

This project is setup to allow you to create a compliant Java EE 6 application using JSF 2.1, CDI 1.0, EJB 3.1, JPA 2.0 , Hibernate-Core and Hibernate Bean Validation.  It includes a persistence unit associated with Hibernate session and some sample persistence and transaction code to help you with database access in enterprise Java. 

This quickstart performs the same functions as the [hibernate3](../hibernate3/README.md) quickstart, but uses Hibernate 4 for database access. Compare this quickstart to the [hibernate3](../hibernate3/README.md) quickstart to see the code changes needed to run with Hibernate 4. 

_Note: This quickstart uses the H2 database included with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6. It is a lightweight, relational example datasource that is used for examples only. It is not robust or scalable, is not supported, and should NOT be used in a production environment!_

_Note: This quickstart uses a `*-ds.xml` datasource configuration file for convenience and ease of database configuration. These files are deprecated in JBoss EAP 6.4 and should not be used in a production environment. Instead, you should configure the datasource using the Management CLI or Management Console. Datasource configuration is documented in the [Administration and Configuration Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/) for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform._

System requirements
-------------------

The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1 or later. 

All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or later, Maven 3.0 or later.

 
Configure Maven
---------------

If you have not yet done so, you must [Configure Maven](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) before testing the quickstarts.


Use of EAP_HOME
---------------

In the following instructions, replace `EAP_HOME` with the actual path to your JBoss EAP 6 installation. The installation path is described in detail here: [Use of EAP_HOME and JBOSS_HOME Variables](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_OF_EAP_HOME.md#use-of-eap_home-and-jboss_home-variables).


Add the Correct Dependencies
---------------------------

JBoss EAP provides Hibernate 4 and JPA support. 

If you use Hibernate 4 packaged within Red Hat JBoss EAP, you will need to first import the JPA API.

This quickstart demonstrates usage of Hibernate Session and Hibernate Validators.

If you look at the pom.xml file in the root of the hibernate4 quickstart directory, you will see that the dependencies for the Hibernate modules have been added with the scope as `provided`.
For example:

      <dependency>
         <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
         <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
         <version>4.2.0.Final</version>
         <scope>provided</scope>
         <exclusions>
            <exclusion>
               <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
               <artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>
            </exclusion>
         </exclusions>
      </dependency>

Please note that if you are working with Hibernate 3, the process is different. You will need to bundle the JARs since JBoss EAP 6 does not ship with Hibernate 3. Refer to the `hibernate3` quickstart for details on how to bundle the JARs.


Start the JBoss EAP Server
-------------------------

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the JBoss EAP directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server:

        For Linux:   EAP_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows: EAP_HOME\bin\standalone.bat

 
Build and Deploy the Quickstart
-------------------------

_NOTE: The following build command assumes you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line. See [Build and Deploy the Quickstarts](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/BUILD_AND_DEPLOY.md#build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) for complete instructions and additional options._

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:

        mvn clean install jboss-as:deploy

4. This will deploy `target/jboss-hibernate4.war` to the running instance of the server.


Access the application 
---------------------

The application will be running at the following URL: <http://localhost:8080/jboss-hibernate4/>.


Server Log: Expected warnings and errors
-----------------------------------

_Note:_ You will see the following warnings in the server log. You can ignore these warnings.

    JBAS010489: -ds.xml file deployments are deprecated. Support may be removed in a future version.

    HHH000431: Unable to determine H2 database version, certain features may not work


Undeploy the Archive
--------------------

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:

        mvn jboss-as:undeploy


Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse
-------------------------------------
You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a JBoss EAP server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see [Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_JBDS.md#use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts) 


Debug the Application
------------------------------------

If you want to debug the source code of any library in the project, run the following command to pull the source into your local repository. The IDE should then detect it.

        mvn dependency:sources
