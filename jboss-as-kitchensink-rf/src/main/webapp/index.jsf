This empty file is required to "trick" the servlet container into beleiveing "index.jsf" exists, and can be used as a
welcome file. Serving of this resource will then instead be performed by the Faces Servlet.

Note: "index.jsf" must be added to the welcome file list in the web.xml for this "trick" to work.
