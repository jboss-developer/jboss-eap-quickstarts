kitchensink-html5-mobile: JAX-RS Services Documentation 
=======================================================
Author: Jay Balunas

This example supports various RESTFul end points which also includes JSONP support for cross domain requests.

By default the base URL for services is `/jboss-as-kitchensink-html5-mobile/rest`.

MemberService End Points
------------------------

### List all members
#### /rest/members

* Request type: GET
* Return type: XML

```

#### /rest/members/new?name=&email=&phoneNumber=

### Get one member by ID

#### /rest/members/\<id>
* Request type: GET
* Return type: XML

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"standalone="yes"?>
<member>

JSONP Support
-------------

[JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) is a technique for allowing cross domain requests from services.  It pads (what the "P" stands for) the service response with a JavaScript callback function that can then access the data on the client.

In order for a request to be padded the following things must be true:

* The request is one of the GET JSON request from above
 * POST requests are not support for JSONP requests
* A query parameter named *jsonpcallback* is defined
 * The value of this parameter is the method that will be defined in the padding

For example:

  http://\<domain:port>/jboss-as-kitchensink-html5-mobile/rest/members/json?jsonpcallback=mycallback
  
See jQuery's documentation for client access examples:

* http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
* http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/

__Validation Error Handling__

When using JSONP requests error responses are not supported.  This is a known issue with JSONP, and has to do with how JSONP requests are sent to the server using \<script> tags.  In the case of a validation issue, or error the success callback will not be thrown, and most client libraries (specifically jquery) will not be able to call the error callback either.  There are some workarounds and options, but typically they are limited.  See your specific client library for more information.

__Security Considerations__

Before using JSONP in your system be aware of some potential security issues that are possible.  There are two primary concerns, cross-site request forgery, and script tag manipulation.  This example show one way to add a layer of security, by only processing JSONP requests with "safe" characters, it makes it more difficult for a site to injects harmful scripts into the return.  You should always consider this and other aspects of security when exposing services in this way.  See the [JSON wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) for more information.
