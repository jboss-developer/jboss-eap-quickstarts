Summary: Demonstrates how to use the Wicket Framework 1.5 with the JBoss EAP server using the Wicket-Stuff Java EE integration, packaged as an EAR  
Target Product: EAP  
Product Versions: EAP 6.1, EAP 6.2  
Source: <https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/>  

What is it?
-----------

This is an example of how to use Wicket Framework 1.5 with JBoss EAP, leveraging features of Java EE 6, using the Wicket-Stuff Java EE integration.

Features used:

* Injection of `@PersistenceContext`
* Injection of a value from `web.xml` using `@Resource`
* Injection of a stateless session bean using `@EJB`

This is an EAR version, with the following structure:

        -`wicket-ear` - parent module
            - `ejb`: Contains EJB beans and JPA entities. Creates a `.jar` file
            - `war`: Contains the Wicket web application, which uses the EJB beans. Creates a `.war` file
            - `ear`: Packages the EJB JAR and WAR into an EAR. Creates an `.ear` file


System requirements
-------------------

The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1 or later. 

All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or later, Maven 3.0 or later.

 
Configure Maven
---------------

If you have not yet done so, you must [Configure Maven](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) before testing the quickstarts.


Start the JBoss EAP Server
-------------------------

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the JBoss EAP directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server:

        For Linux:   EAP_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows: EAP_HOME\bin\standalone.bat


Build and Deploy the Quickstart
-------------------------

_NOTE: The following build command assumes you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line. See [Build and Deploy the Quickstarts](../README.md#build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) for complete instructions and additional options._

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:

        mvn clean install jboss-as:deploy

4. This will deploy `target/jboss-wicket-ear.ear` to the running instance of the server.


Access the application 
----------------------

The application will be running at the following URL: <http://localhost:8080/jboss-wicket-ear-war/>.

 * You will see a page with a table listing the existing Contact entities. Initially, this table is empty.
 * Click on the _Insert a new Constact_ link to add a new contact.


Server Log: Expected warnings and errors
-----------------------------------

_Note:_ You will see the following warning in the server log. You can ignore this warning.

        HHH000431: Unable to determine H2 database version, certain features may not work


Undeploy the Archive
--------------------

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:

        mvn jboss-as:undeploy


Run the Quickstart in JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse
-------------------------------------
You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For more information, see [Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_JDBS.md#use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts) 


Debug the Application
---------------------

If you want to debug the source code or look at the Javadocs of any library in the project, run either of the following commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect them.

        mvn dependency:sources
        mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc
