What is it?  
-----------
The `spring-petclinic` quickstart shows how to run the [Spring PetClinic](<http://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic>) Application 
in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform with the use of Red Hat JBoss EAP BOMs (_for the best compatibility_). One of the major 
changes is the use of the `webapp/WEB-INF/jboss-deployment-structure.xml` file. This file specifies which modules 
to include or exclude when building the application. In this case, we exclude Hibernate libraries since the application 
uses Spring Data JPA. Additionally, this is only required when using the spring-data-jpa profile, see `resources/spring/business-config.xml`.

For detailed explanation of the changes made to adapt the Quickstart to Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform see: [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md)

PetClinic features alternative DAO implementations and application configurations for JDBC, JPA, and Spring Data JPA, with 
HSQLDB and MySQL as target databases. The default PetClinic configuration is JDBC on HSQLDB.  

* The `src/main/resources/spring/business-config.xml` pulls in `src/main/resources/spring/data-access.properties` to set 
the JDBC-related settings for the JPA EntityManager definition. 
    * A simple comment change in `data-access.properties` switches between the data access strategies. 
* In `webapp/WEB_INF/web.xml` the `<param-name>spring.profiles.active</param-name>` using `<param-value>jpa</param-value>` 
(_as the default_) refers to the bean to be used in `src/main/resources/spring/business-config.xml`. 
    * Setting the `<param-value>` to `jdbc`, `jpa`, or `spring-data-jpa` is all that is needed to change the DAO implementation.

All versions of PetClinic also demonstrate JMX support via the use of `<context:mbean-export/>` in `resources/spring/tools-config.xml` 
for exporting MBeans. The `CallMonitoringAspect.java` is exposed using Spring's `@ManagedResource` and `@ManagedOperation`
annotations and with `@Around` annotation we add monitoring around all `org.springframework.stereotype.Repository *` functions. 
You can start up the JDK's JConsole to manage the exported bean.

The use of `@Cacheable` is also demonstrated in `ClinicServiceImpl.java` by caching the results of the method `findVets`.
The cacheManager in configured in `tools-config.xml` and `ehcache.xml` specifies the `vets` cache properties.

The default transaction manager for JDBC is DataSourceTransactionManager and for JPA and Spring Data JPA, JpaTransactionManager.
Those local strategies allow for working with any locally defined DataSource. These are defined in the `business-config.xml`

_Note that the sample configurations for JDBC, JPA, and Spring Data JPA configure a BasicDataSource from the Apache Commons 
DBCP project for connection pooling. See `datasource-config.xml`._

System requirements  
-------------------

The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP) 6.1 or later.

All you need to build this project is Java 7.0 or later and Maven 3.0 or later.

_Note: Unlike the other quickstarts, the source for this example is taken directly from the Spring samples repository and 
does not compile with Java 6.0._


Configure Maven
---------------

If you have not yet done so, you must [Configure Maven](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) before testing the quickstarts.


Start the JBoss EAP Server  
-------------------------

1. Open a command line and navigate to the root of the JBoss EAP directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server with the default profile:

        For Linux:   EAP_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows: EAP_HOME\bin\standalone.bat


Build and Deploy the Quickstart
-------------------------

_NOTE: The following build command assumes you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include 
Maven setting arguments on the command line. See [Build and Deploy the Quickstarts](../README.md#build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) for complete 
instructions and additional options._

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:

        mvn clean package jboss-as:deploy

4. This will deploy `petclinic-spring/target/jboss-petclinic-spring.war` to the running instance of the server.

If you don't have maven configured you can manually copy `petclinic-spring/target/jboss-petclinic-spring.war` to EAP_HOME/standalone/deployments.

For MySQL, you'll need to use the corresponding schema and SQL scripts in the "db/mysql" subdirectory.

In you intend to use a local DataSource, the JDBC settings can be adapted in "src/main/resources/spring/datasource-config.xml". 
To use a JTA DataSource, you need to set up corresponding DataSources in your Java EE container.

 
Access the application
---------------------

The application will be running at the following URL: <http://localhost:8080/jboss-petclinic-spring/>.


Undeploy the Archive
--------------------

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:

        mvn jboss-as:undeploy


Run the Arquillian Functional Tests
-----------------------------------

This quickstart provides Arquillian functional tests as well. They are located in the functional-tests/ subdirectory under 
the root directory of this quickstart. Functional tests verify that your application behaves correctly from the user's point 
of view. The tests open a browser instance, simulate clicking around the page as a normal user would do, and then close the browser instance.

To run these tests, you must build the main project as described above.

1. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
2. Build the quickstart WAR using the following command:

        mvn clean package

3. Navigate to the functional-tests/ directory in this quickstart.
4. If you have a running instance of the JBoss EAP server, as described above, run the remote tests by typing the following command:

        mvn clean verify -Parq-jbossas-remote

5. If you prefer to run the functional tests using managed instance of the JBoss EAP server, meaning the tests will start the 
server for you, type the following command:

        mvn clean verify -Parq-jbossas-managed

_Note:_ The spring-petclinic quickstart contains three configurations: JDBC, JPA, and Spring Data JPA. You should see the tests run 3 times, one for each configuration. 

Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse
-------------------------------------
You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For more information, see [Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_JBDS.md#use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts) 


Debug the Application
----------------------

Note: Eclipse/JBDS may generate a persistence.xml file in the src/main/resources/META-INF/ directory. In order to avoid 
errors delete this file.

If you want to debug the source code or look at the Javadocs of any library in the project, run either of the following 
commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect them.

        mvn dependency:sources
        mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc
