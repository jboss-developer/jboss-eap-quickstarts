= {productNameFull} ({productName}) Quickstarts

[abstract]
The quickstarts demonstrate {javaVersion} and a few additional technologies from the JBoss stack. They provide small, specific, working examples that can be used as a reference for your own project.

[[introduction]]
== Introduction

These quickstarts run on {productNameFull} {productVersion} or later. We recommend using the {productName} ZIP file. This version uses the correct dependencies and ensures you test and compile against your runtime environment.

[[use_of_product_home_and_jboss_home_variables]]
== Use of {jbossHomeName} and JBOSS_HOME Variables

The quickstart `README` files use the _replaceable_ value `__{jbossHomeName}__` to denote the path to the {productName} installation. When you encounter this value in a `README` file, make sure you replace it with the actual path to your {productName} installation. The installation path is described in detail here: link:{useProductHomeDocUrl}[Use of __{jbossHomeName}__ and __JBOSS_HOME__ Variables].

[[available_quickstarts]]
== Available Quickstarts

All available quickstarts can be found here: {githubRepoUrl}. You can review the technologies demonstrated by the quickstart. You can also view the required experience level. Click on the quickstart to see more detailed information about how to run it. Some quickstarts require deployment of other quickstarts. This information is noted in the `Prerequisites` section of the quickstart `README` file.

NOTE: Some of these quickstarts use the H2 database included with {productName}. It is a lightweight, relational example datasource that is used for examples only. It is not robust or scalable, is not supported, and should NOT be used in a production environment!

[[suggested_approach_to_the_quickstarts]]
== Suggested Approach to the Quickstarts

We suggest you approach the quickstarts as follows:

* Regardless of your level of expertise, we suggest you start with the `helloworld` quickstart. It is the simplest example and is an easy way to prove your server is configured and started correctly.
* If you are a beginner or new to JBoss, start with the quickstarts labeled `Beginner`, then try those marked as `Intermediate`. When you are comfortable with those, move on to the `Advanced` quickstarts.
* Some quickstarts are based upon other quickstarts but have expanded capabilities and functionality. If a prerequisite quickstart is listed, make sure you deploy and test it before looking at the expanded version.

[[system_requirements]]
== System Requirements

The applications these projects produce are designed to be run on {productNameFull} {productVersion} or later.

All you need to build these projects is {buildRequirements}. See link:{configureMavenDocUrl}[Configure Maven to Build and Deploy the Quickstarts] to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.

To run these quickstarts with the provided build scripts, you need the {productName} distribution ZIP. For information on how to install and run JBoss, see the {LinkGettingStartedGuide}[__{GettingStartedBookName}__] located on the Red Hat Customer Portal.

You can also run the quickstarts in xref:run_the_quickstarts_in_jboss_developer_studio_or_eclipse[JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse].

[[run_the_quickstarts]]
== Run the Quickstarts

The root folder of each individual quickstart contains a `README` file with specific details on how to build and run the example. In most cases you do the following:

* link:{StartServerDocUrl}[Start the {productName} Server]
* xref:build_and_deploy_the_quickstarts[Build and Deploy the Quickstarts]

[[build_and_deploy_the_quickstarts]]
=== Build and Deploy the Quickstarts

See the `README` file in each individual quickstart folder for specific details and information on how to run and access the example.

[[build_the_quickstart_archive]]
==== Build the Quickstart Archive

In most cases, you can use the following steps to build the application to test for compile errors or to view the contents of the archive. See the specific quickstart `README` file for complete details.

. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the quickstart you want to build.
. Use the following command if you only want to build the archive, but not deploy it.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean install
----

[[build_and_deploy_the_quickstart]]
==== Build and Deploy the Quickstart

This section describes the basic steps to build and deploy an application. See the specific instructions in each quickstart `README` file for any variations to this process.

. Make sure you start the {productName} server as described in the quickstart `README` file.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the quickstart you want to run.
. Use the following command to build and deploy the archive.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean install wildfly:deploy
----

[[undeploy_an_archive]]
==== Undeploy an Archive

Use the following command to undeploy the quickstart.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn wildfly:undeploy
----

[[verify_the_quickstarts_build_with_one_command]]
=== Verify the Quickstarts Build with One Command

You can verify the quickstarts build using one command. However, quickstarts that have complex dependencies must be skipped. For example, the `resteasy-jaxrs-client` quickstart is a RESTEasy client that depends on the deployment of the `helloworld-rs` quickstart. As noted above, the root `pom.xml` file defines a `complex-dependencies` profile to exclude these quickstarts from the root build process.

To build all of the quickstarts:

. Do not start the {productName} server.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the quickstarts.
. Use the following command to build the quickstarts that do not have complex dependencies:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean install '-Pdefault,!complex-dependencies'
----

[[undeploy_the_deployed_quickstarts_with_one_command]]
=== Undeploy the Deployed Quickstarts with One Command

To undeploy the quickstarts from the root of the quickstart folder, you must pass the argument `-fae` (fail at end) on the command line. This allows the command to continue past quickstarts that fail due to complex dependencies and quickstarts that only have Arquillian tests and do not deploy archives to the server.

You can undeploy quickstarts using the following procedure:

. Start the {productName} server.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the quickstarts.
. Use the following command to undeploy any deployed quickstarts.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn wildfly:undeploy -fae
----

To undeploy any quickstarts that fail due to complex dependencies, follow the undeploy procedure described in the quickstart's `README` file.

[[run_the_quickstarts_in_jboss_developer_studio_or_eclipse]]
== Run the Quickstarts in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse

You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a {productName} server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see link:{useEclipseUrl}[Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts].

[[optional_components]]
== Optional Components

The following components are needed for only a small subset of the quickstarts. Do not install or configure them unless the quickstart requires it.

* link:{addUserDocUrl}[Create Users Required by the Quickstarts]: Add a Management or Application user for the quickstarts that run in a secured mode.

* link:{configurePostgresDocUrl}[Configure the PostgreSQL Database for Use with the Quickstarts]: The PostgreSQL database is used for the distributed transaction quickstarts.

* link:{configureBytemanQuickstartsDocUrl}[Configure Byteman for Use with the Quickstarts]: This tool is used to demonstrate crash recovery for distributed transaction quickstarts.
