<h1>JBoss AS Quickstarts</h1>
<p>Quickstarts (or examples, or samples) for JBoss AS. There are a number of rules for quickstarts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each quickstart should have a unique name, this enables a user to quickly identify each quickstart</li>
<li>A quickstart should have a simple build that the user can quickly understand. If using maven it should:</li>
<li>Not inherit from another POM</li>
<li>Import the various BOMs from AS7 APIs to get version numbers</li>
<li>Use the JBoss AS Maven Plugin to deploy the example</li>
<li>The quickstart should be importable into JBoss Tools and deployable there</li>
<li>The quickstart should be explained in detail in the associated user guide, including how to deploy</li>
<li>If you add a quickstart, don't forget to update <code>dist/src/main/assembly/README.md</code> and <code>pom.xml</code> (the 'modules' section).</li>
<li>The quickstart should be formatted using the JBoss AS profiles found at <a href="https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as/tree/master/ide-configs">https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as/tree/master/ide-configs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the documentation at <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Documentation">https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Documentation</a>.</p>
<p>If you add a quickstart, don't forget to update <code>dist/src/main/assembly/README.md</code>.</p>
<p>The 'dist' folder contains Maven scripts to build a zip of the quickstarts.</p>

<h2>Quickstarts in other repositories</h2>
<p>If your quickstarts are stored in another repository, you may wish to merge them in from there, rather than contribute them from source. If you plan to do this, discuss first with the JBoss AS Quickstarts team, as they will want to review all commits to <em>your</em> repo going forward.</p>
<p>To do this</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add the other repo as a remote</p>
<p>git remote add -f <other repo> <other repo url></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merge from the tag in the other repo that you wish to use. It is important to use a tag, to make tracking of history easier. We use a recursive merge strategy, always preferring changes from the other repo, in effect overwriting what we have locally.</p>
<p>git merge <tag> -s recursive -Xtheirs --no-commit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The merge is not committed, so any updates to the README.md and parent POM can be made. Having made these, perform the merge. We suggest updating the commit message to "Merge <Other Project Name> '<Tag>'".</p>
<p>git commit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review and push to upstream</p>
<p>git push upstream HEAD:master</p>
</li>
</ol>
