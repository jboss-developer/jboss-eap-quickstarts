helloworld-jms: HelloWorld JMS Example
======================
Author: Weston Price

What is it?
-----------

This quickstart demonstrates the use of external JMS clients with JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7.

It contains the following:

1. A message producer that sends messages to a JMS destination deployed to a JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7 server.

2. A message consumer that receives message from a JMS destination deployed to a JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7 server. 


System requirements
-------------------

All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or better, Maven 3.0 or better.

The application this project produces is designed to be run on JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7. 


Configure Maven
---------------

If you have not yet done so, you must [Configure Maven](../README.html/#mavenconfiguration) before testing the quickstarts.


Add an Application User
----------------
This quickstart uses secured management interfaces and requires that you create an application user to access the running application. Instructions to set up the quickstart application user can be found here: [Add an Application User](../README.html/#addapplicationuser)


Start JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7 with the Full Profile
---------------

1. Open a command line and navigate to the root of the JBoss server directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server with the full profile:

        For Linux:   JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
        For Windows: JBOSS_HOME\bin\standalone.bat -c standalone-full.xml


Build and Deploy the Quickstart
-------------------------

To run the quickstart from the command line:

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss server. See the instructions in the previous section.

2. Open a command line and navigate to the root of the helloworld-jms quickstart directory:

      cd PATH_TO_QUICKSTARTS/helloworld-jms

3. Type the following command to compile and execute the quickstart:

       For JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 (Maven user settings NOT configured): 

           mvn clean compile exec:java -s PATH_TO_QUICKSTARTS/example-settings.xml

       For JBoss AS 7 or JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 (Maven user settings configured): 

           mvn clean compile exec:java

 
Investigate the Console Output
-------------------------

If the maven command is successful, with the default configuration you will see output similar to this:

    Mar 14, 2012 1:38:58 PM org.jboss.as.quickstarts.jms.HelloWorldJMSClient main
    INFO: Attempting to acquire connection factory "jms/RemoteConnectionFactory"

    INFO: Found connection factory "jms/RemoteConnectionFactory" in JNDI

    INFO: Received message with content Hello, World!



Optional Properties
-------------------

The example provides for a certain amount of customization for the `mvn:exec` plugin using the system properties.

* `username`
   
    This username is used for both the JMS connection and the JNDI look-up.  Instructions to set up the quickstart application user can be found here: [Add an Application User](../README.html/#addapplicationuser).
   
    Default: `quickstartUser`
		
* `password`

    This password is used for both the JMS connection and the JNDI look-up.  Instructions to set up the quickstart application user can be found here: [Add an Application User](../README.html/#addapplicationuser)
   
    Default: `quickstartPassword`

* `connection.factory`

    The name of the JMS ConnectionFactory you want to use.

    Default: `jms/RemoteConnectionFactory`

* `destination`

    The name of the JMS Destination you want to use.
   
    Default: `jms/queue/test`

* `message.count`

    The number of JMS messages you want to produce and consume.

    Default: `1`

* `message.content`

    The content of the JMS TextMessage.
	
    Default: `"Hello, World!"`

* `jboss.naming.provider.url`

	  This property allows configuration of the JNDI directory used to lookup the JMS destination. This is useful when the client resides on another host. 

    Default: `"localhost"`



Run the Quickstart in JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse
-------------------------------------
You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For more information, see [Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts](../README.html/#useeclipse) 


Debug the Application
------------------------------------

If you want to debug the source code or look at the Javadocs of any library in the project, run either of the following commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect them.

      mvn dependency:sources
      mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc
