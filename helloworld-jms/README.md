helloworld-jms: HelloWorld JMS Example
======================
Author: Weston Price  
Level: Intermediate  
Technologies: JMS  
Summary: Demonstrates the use of a standalone (Java SE) JMS client  
Target Product: EAP  
Product Versions: EAP 6.1, EAP 6.2  
Source: <https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/>  

What is it?
-----------

This quickstart demonstrates the use of external JMS clients with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.

It contains the following:

1. A message producer that sends messages to a JMS destination deployed to a JBoss server.

2. A message consumer that receives message from a JMS destination deployed to a JBoss server. 


System requirements
-------------------

The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1 or later. 

All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or later, Maven 3.0 or later.


Configure Maven
---------------

If you have not yet done so, you must [Configure Maven](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) before testing the quickstarts.


Add an Application User
----------------

This quickstart uses secured management interfaces and requires that you create the following application user to access the running application. 

| **UserName** | **Realm** | **Password** | **Roles** |
|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|
| quickstartUser| ApplicationRealm | quickstartPwd!!| guest |

To add the application user, open a command prompt and type the following command:

        For Linux:   JBOSS_HOME/bin/add-user.sh -a -u 'quickstartUser' -p 'quickstartPwd1!' -g 'guest'
        For Windows: JBOSS_HOME\bin\add-user.bat  -a -u 'quickstartUser' -p 'quickstartPwd1!' -g 'guest'

If you prefer, you can use the add-user utility interactively. 
For an example of how to use the add-user utility, see instructions in the root README file located here: [Add an Application User](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CREATE_USERS.md#add-an-application-user).


Configure the JBoss Server
---------------------------

You configure the the JMS `test` queue by running JBoss CLI commands. For your convenience, this quickstart batches the commands into a `configure-jms.cli` script provided in the root directory of this quickstart. 

1. Before you begin, back up your server configuration file
    * If it is running, stop the JBoss server.
    * Backup the file: `JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml`
    * After you have completed testing this quickstart, you can replace this file to restore the server to its original configuration.
2. Start the JBoss server by typing the following: 

        For Linux:  JBOSS_HOME_SERVER_1/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
        For Windows:  JBOSS_HOME_SERVER_1\bin\standalone.bat -c standalone-full.xml
3. Review the `configure-jms.cli` file in the root of this quickstart directory. This script adds the `test` queue to the `messaging` subsystem in the server configuration file.

4. Open a new command prompt, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command, replacing JBOSS_HOME with the path to your server:

        JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=configure-jms.cli 
You should see the following result when you run the script:

        #1 jms-queue add --queue-address=testQueue --entries=queue/test,java:jboss/exported/jms/queue/test
        The batch executed successfully.
        {"outcome" => "success"}



Review the Modified Server Configuration
-----------------------------------

If you want to review and understand newly added XML configuration, stop the JBoss server and open the  `JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml` file. 

The following `testQueue` jms-queue was configured in a new `<jms-destinations>` element under the hornetq-server section of the `messaging` subsystem.

      <jms-destinations>
          <jms-queue name="testQueue">
              <entry name="queue/test"/>
              <entry name="java:jboss/exported/jms/queue/test"/>
          </jms-queue>
      </jms-destinations>
 

Start the JBoss Server with the Full Profile
---------------

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the JBoss server directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server with the full profile:

        For Linux:   JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
        For Windows: JBOSS_HOME\bin\standalone.bat -c standalone-full.xml


Build and Execute the Quickstart
-------------------------

To run the quickstart from the command line:

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss server. See the instructions in the previous section.

2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the helloworld-jms quickstart directory:

        cd PATH_TO_QUICKSTARTS/helloworld-jms

3. Type the following command to compile and execute the quickstart:

        mvn clean compile exec:java

 
Investigate the Console Output
-------------------------

If the maven command is successful, with the default configuration you will see output similar to this:

    Mar 14, 2012 1:38:58 PM org.jboss.as.quickstarts.jms.HelloWorldJMSClient main
    INFO: Attempting to acquire connection factory "jms/RemoteConnectionFactory"
    Mar 14, 2012 1:38:58 PM org.jboss.as.quickstarts.jms.HelloWorldJMSClient main
    INFO: Found connection factory "jms/RemoteConnectionFactory" in JNDI
    Mar 14, 2012 1:38:58 PM org.jboss.as.quickstarts.jms.HelloWorldJMSClient main
    INFO: Attempting to acquire destination "jms/queue/test"
    Mar 14, 2012 1:38:58 PM org.jboss.as.quickstarts.jms.HelloWorldJMSClient main
    INFO: Found destination "jms/queue/test" in JNDI
    Mar 14, 2012 1:38:58 PM org.jboss.as.quickstarts.jms.HelloWorldJMSClient main
    INFO: Sending 1 messages with content: Hello, World!
    Mar 14, 2012 1:38:58 PM org.jboss.as.quickstarts.jms.HelloWorldJMSClient main
    INFO: Received message with content Hello, World!

_Note_: After the above INFO message, you may see the following error. You can ignore the error as it is a well known error message and does not indicate the maven command was unsuccessful in any way. 

    Mar 14, 2012 1:38:58 PM org.jboss.naming.remote.protocol.v1.RemoteNamingStoreV1$MessageReceiver handleEnd
    ERROR: Channel end notification received, closing channel Channel ID cd114175 (outbound) of Remoting connection 00392fe8 to localhost/127.0.0.1:4447


Optional Properties
-------------------

The example provides for a certain amount of customization for the `mvn:exec` plugin using the system properties.

* `username`
   
    This username is used for both the JMS connection and the JNDI look-up.  Instructions to set up the quickstart application user can be found here: [Add an Application User](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CREATE_USERS.md#add-an-application-user).
   
    Default: `quickstartUser`
		
* `password`

    This password is used for both the JMS connection and the JNDI look-up.  Instructions to set up the quickstart application user can be found here: [Add an Application User](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CREATE_USERS.md#add-an-application-user)
   
    Default: `quickstartPwd1!`

* `connection.factory`

    The name of the JMS ConnectionFactory you want to use.

    Default: `jms/RemoteConnectionFactory`

* `destination`

    The name of the JMS Destination you want to use.
   
    Default: `jms/queue/test`

* `message.count`

    The number of JMS messages you want to produce and consume.

    Default: `1`

* `message.content`

    The content of the JMS TextMessage.
	
    Default: `"Hello, World!"`

* `java.naming.provider.url`

	  This property allows configuration of the JNDI directory used to lookup the JMS destination. This is useful when the client resides on another host. 

    Default: `"localhost"`


Remove the JMS Configuration
----------------------------

You can remove the JMS configuration by running the  `remove-jms.cli` script provided in the root directory of this quickstart or by manually restoring the back-up copy the configuration file. 

### Remove the JMS Configuration by Running the JBoss CLI Script

1. Start the JBoss server by typing the following: 

        For Linux:  JBOSS_HOME_SERVER_1/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
        For Windows:  JBOSS_HOME_SERVER_1\bin\standalone.bat -c standalone-full.xml
2. Open a new command prompt, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command, replacing JBOSS_HOME with the path to your server:

        JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=remove-jms.cli 
This script removes the `test` queue from the `messaging` subsystem in the server configuration. You should see the following result when you run the script:

        #1 jms-queue remove --queue-address=testQueue
        The batch executed successfully.
        {"outcome" => "success"}


### Remove the JMS Configuration Manually
1. If it is running, stop the JBoss server.
2. Replace the `JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml` file with the back-up copy of the file.


Run the Quickstart in JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse
-------------------------------------
You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For more information, see [Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_JDBS.md#use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts) 


Debug the Application
------------------------------------

If you want to debug the source code or look at the Javadocs of any library in the project, run either of the following commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect them.

        mvn dependency:sources
        mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc
