<h1>payment-cdi-event: Use CDI Events to Process Debit and Credit Operations</h1>
<p>Author: Elvadas Nono</p>
<p>This quickstart demonstrates how to use <em>CDI 1.0 Events</em> in JBoss AS 7 or JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.
The JSF front-end client allows you to create both credit and debit operation events.</p>
<p>To test this quickstart, enter an amount, choose either a Credit or Debit operation,
and then click on <em>Pay</em> to create the event.</p>
<p>A Session scoped (@SessionScoped) payment event handler catches the operation
 and produces (@Produces) a named list of all operations performed during this session. 
The event is logged in the JBoss console and the event list is displayed in
 a table at the bottom of the form.</p>
<p>The payment-cdi-event quickstart defines the following classes</p>
<ul>
<li>PaymentBean: <ul>
<li>A session scoped bean that stores the payment form information: <ul>
<li>payment amount</li>
<li>operation type: debit or credit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It contains the following utilities methods:<ul>
<li>public String pay(): Process the operation when the user clicks on submit. We have only one JSP page, so the method does not return anything and the flow of control doesn't change.</li>
<li>public void reset(): Clear the payment form data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PaymentEvent: We have only one Event. It handles both credit and debit operations. Qualifiers help us to make the difference at injection point.</li>
<li>PaymentTypeEnum:  A typesafe enum is used to represent the operation payment type. It contains utility methods to convert between String and Enum.</li>
<li>The qualifiers package contains the Credit and Debit classes. The annotation determines the operation of injecting Event.</li>
<li>The handler package containss Interfaces and implementations of PaymentEvent Observers.<ul>
<li>ICreditEventObserver: Interface to listen to CREDIT Event Only (@Observes @Credit).</li>
<li>IDebitEventObserver: Interface to listen to DEBIT Event (@Observes @Debit).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PaymentHandler: <ul>
<li>The concrete implementation of the payment handler, it implements both IcreditEventObserver and IDebitEventObserver.</li>
<li>The payment handler exposes the list of events caught during a session ( @Named  name=payments).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>System requirements</h2>
<p>All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or better, Maven
3.0 or better.</p>
<p>The application this project produces is designed to be run on a JBoss AS 7.</p>
<p>With the prerequisites out of the way, you're ready to build and deploy.</p>
<h2>Deploying the Application</h2>
<p>First you need to start JBoss AS 7. To do this, run</p>
<pre><code>$JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
</code></pre>
<p>or if you are using Windows</p>
<pre><code>$JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.bat
</code></pre>
<p>To deploy the application, you first need to produce the archive to deploy using
the following Maven goal:</p>
<pre><code>mvn clean package
</code></pre>
<p>You can now deploy the artifact to JBoss AS by executing the following command:</p>
<pre><code>mvn jboss-as:deploy
</code></pre>
<p>This will deploy <code>target/jboss-as-payment-cdi-event.war</code>.</p>
<p>The application will be running at the following URL <a href="http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-payment-cdi-event/">http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-payment-cdi-event/</a>.</p>
<p>To undeploy from JBoss AS, run this command:</p>
<pre><code>mvn jboss-as:undeploy
</code></pre>
<p>You can also start JBoss AS 7 and deploy the project using Eclipse. See the JBoss AS 7
Getting Started Guide for Developers for more information.</p>
