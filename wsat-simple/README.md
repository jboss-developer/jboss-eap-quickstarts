Summary: Deployment of a WS-AT (WS-AtomicTransaction) enabled JAX-WS Web service bundled in a WAR archive  
Target Product: EAP

What is it?
-----------

This example demonstrates the deployment of a WS-AT (WS-AtomicTransaction) enabled JAX-WS Web service bundled in a WAR archive for deployment to Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.

The Web service is offered by a Restaurant for making bookings. The Service allows bookings to be made within an Atomic Transaction.

This example demonstrates the basics of implementing a WS-AT enabled Web service. It is beyond the scope of this quick start to demonstrate more advanced features. In particular:

1. The Service does not implement the required hooks to support recovery in the presence of failures.
2. It also does not utilize a transactional back end resource.
3. Only one Web service participates in the protocol. As WS-AT is a 2PC coordination protocol, it is best suited to multi-participant scenarios.

For a more complete example, please see the XTS demonstrator application that ships with the JBossTS project: http://www.jboss.org/jbosstm.

It is also assumed that you have an understanding of WS-AtomicTransaction. For more details, read the XTS documentation that ships with the JBossTS project, which can be downloaded here: http://www.jboss.org/jbosstm/downloads/JBOSSTS_4_16_0_Final

The application consists of a single JAX-WS web service that is deployed within a WAR archive. It is tested with a JBoss Arquillian enabled JUnit test.

When running the `org.jboss.as.quickstarts.wsat.simple.ClientTest#testCommit()` method, the following steps occur:

1. A new Atomic Transaction (AT) is created by the client.
2. An operation on a WS-AT enabled Web service is invoked by the client.
3. The JaxWSHeaderContextProcessor in the WS Client handler chain inserts the WS-AT context into the outgoing SOAP message
4. When the service receives the SOAP request, the JaxWSHeaderContextProcessor in its handler chain inspects the WS-AT context and associates the request with this AT.
5. The Web service operation is invoked...
6. A participant is enlisted in this AT. This allows the Web Service logic to respond to protocol events, such as Commit and Rollback.
7. The service invokes the business logic. In this case, a booking is made with the restaurant.
8. The backend resource is prepared. This ensures that the Backend resource can undo or make permanent the change when told to do so by the coordinator.
10. The client can then decide to commit or rollback the AT. If the client decides to commit, the coordinator will begin the 2PC protocol. If the participant decides to rollback, all participants will be told to rollback.

There is another test that shows what happens if the client decides to rollback the AT.


System requirements
-------------------

The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1 or later. 

All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or later, Maven 3.0 or later.

 
Configure Maven
---------------

If you have not yet done so, you must [Configure Maven](../README.md#configure-maven) before testing the quickstarts.


Start the JBoss Server with the Custom Options
----------------------

First, edit the log level to reduce the amount of log output. This should make it easier to read the logs produced by this example. To do this add the
following logger block to the ./docs/examples/configs/standalone-xts.xml of your JBoss distribution. You should add it just bellow one of the other logger blocks.

        <logger category="org.apache.cxf.service.factory.ReflectionServiceFactoryBean">
            <level name="WARN"/>
        </logger>         

Next you need to start JBoss EAP with the XTS sub system enabled. This is enabled through the optional server configuration *standalone-xts.xml*. To do this, run the following commands from the top-level directory of JBossAS:

        For Linux:     ./bin/standalone.sh --server-config=../../docs/examples/configs/standalone-xts.xml
        For Windows:   \bin\standalone.bat --server-config=..\..\docs\examples\configs\standalone-xts.xml


Run the Arquillian Tests 
-------------------------

This quickstart provides Arquillian tests. By default, these tests are configured to be skipped as Arquillian tests require the use of a container. 

_NOTE: The following commands assume you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line. See [Run the Arquillian Tests](../README.md#run-the-arquillian-tests) for complete instructions and additional options._

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss Server as described above.
2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type the following command to run the test goal with the following profile activated:

        mvn clean test -Parq-jbossas-remote 


Investigate the Console Output
----------------------------

The following expected output should appear. Note there will be some other log messages interlaced between these. The output explains what actually went on when these tests ran.

Test commit:

Run the Quickstart in JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse
-------------------------------------
You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For more information, see [Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts](../README.md#use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts) 


Debug the Application
------------------------------------

If you want to debug the source code or look at the Javadocs of any library in the project, run either of the following commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect them.

        mvn dependency:sources
        mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc
