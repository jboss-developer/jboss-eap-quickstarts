kitchensink-cordova: Example AeroGear Application Using Hybrid HTML5 + REST with Apache Cordova
===============================================================================================
Author: Kris Borchers
Level: Intermediate
Technologies: HTML5, REST, Apache Cordova
Summary: Based on kitchensink, but uses hybrid HTML5 running as a native application on mobiles

What is it?
-----------

This project serves as an example of AeroGear's [kitchensink quickstart](http://www.github.com/aerogear/as-quickstarts/tree/master/kitchensink-html5-mobile), converted to an [Apache Cordova](http://incubator.apache.org/cordova/) based, hybrid application. 

What does all of that mean? Basically, this takes our https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-17326[HTML5 + REST] / http://www.jquerymobile.com"[jQuery Mobile] based web app and converts it to a native app for both iOS and Android. Currently, these apps will need to be built separately but in the future, we hope to provide a single build step for all supported mobile OS types. These concepts can be applied to the conversion of most HTML5/JS based web apps by just replacing the specific paths described in this article with paths that match your environment.
