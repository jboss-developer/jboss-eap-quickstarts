Prerequisites: helloworld-rs  
Target Product: JBoss EAP

What is it?
-----------

The `resteasy-jaxrs-client` quickstart demonstrates an external JAX-RS RestEasy client which interacts with a JAX-RS Web service that uses *CDI* and *JAX-RS* 
in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.

This client "calls" the HelloWorld JAX-RS Web Service that was created in the [helloworld-rs](../helloworld-rs/README.md) quickstart. See the **Prerequisite** section below for details on how to build and deploy the [helloworld-rs](../helloworld-rs/README.md) quickstart.


System requirements
-------------------

The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7 or later. 

All you need to build this project is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later, Maven 3.0 or later.

 
Configure Maven
---------------

If you have not yet done so, you must [Configure Maven](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) before testing the quickstarts.


Prerequisites
-----------

IMPORTANT: This quickstart depends on the deployment of the 'helloworld-rs' quickstart for its test. Before running this quickstart, see the [helloworld-rs](../helloworld-rs/README.md)  README file for details on how to deploy it.

You can verify the deployment of the [helloworld-rs](../helloworld-rs/README.md) quickstart by accessing the following content:

* The *XML* content can be viewed by accessing the following URL: <http://localhost:8080/jboss-helloworld-rs/rest/xml> 
* The *JSON* content can be viewed by accessing this URL: <http://localhost:8080/jboss-helloworld-rs/rest/json>



Run the Arquillian Tests 
-------------------------

This quickstart provides Arquillian tests. 

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Make sure the `helloworld-rs` quickstart has been deployed on the server as noted in the **Prerequisites** section above.
3. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
4. Type the following command to run the test goal with the following profile activated:

        mvn clean test 


Investigate the Console Output
----------------------------

This command will compile the example and execute a test to make two separate requests to the Web Service.  Towards the end of the Maven build output, you 
should see the following if the execution is successful:

        ===============================================
        URL: http://localhost:8080/jboss-helloworld-rs/rest/xml
        MediaType: application/xml

        *** Response from Server ***

        <xml><result>Hello World!</result></xml>
    
        ===============================================
        ===============================================
        URL: http://localhost:8080/jboss-helloworld-rs/rest/json
        MediaType: application/json

        *** Response from Server ***

        {"result":"Hello World!"}
        ===============================================


OpenShift
---------

To make this quickstart more interesting, deploy the RESTful service to OpenShift.  The following instructions will guide you as to the modifications that must be made to successfully execute the `resteasy-jaxrs-client` against a service deployed to OpenShift.


Build and Deploy the Quickstart - to OpenShift
-------------------------

_IMPORTANT_: This quickstart depends on the deployment of the `helloworld-rs` quickstart to OpenShift for its test. Follow the instructions [Build and Deploy the Quickstart - to OpenShift](../helloworld-rs/README.md#build-and-deploy-the-quickstart-to-openshift) in the helloworld-rs README to deploy that application to OpenShift. Do NOT yet follow the step "Delete the OpenShift Application".

As it says in the `helloworld-rs` instructions, you can verify the deployment of the `helloworld-rs` quickstart by accessing the following content. In these instructions, be sure to replace all instances of `YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME` with your own OpenShift account user name.

* <http://helloworldrs-YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME.rhcloud.com/rest/xml> if you want *xml* or
* <http://helloworldrs-YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME.rhcloud.com/rest/json> if you want *json*


### Modify the resteasy-jaxrs-client quickstart pom.xml

Now that you have deployed the application, it is time to make changes to the `resteasy-jaxrs-client` quickstart Arquillian tests. 

1. Open a shell command prompt and navigate to the `QUICKSTART_HOME/resteasy-jaxrs-client/` directory.
2. Make a backup copy of the `pom.xml` file.
3. Open the `pom.xml` file in an editor and modify the `xmlUrl` and `jsonUrl` property values as follows. Be sure to replace the `YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME` in the URL with your OpenShift domain name.

        <property>
            <name>xmlUrl</name>
            <value>http://helloworldrs-YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME.rhcloud.com/rest/xml</value>
        </property>
        <property>
            <name>jsonUrl</name>
            <value>http://helloworldrs-YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME.rhcloud.com/rest/json</value>
        </property>


### Run the Maven test

Type the following command to run the `resteasy-jaxrs-client`:

        mvn test

This command will compile the example and execute a test to make two separate requests to the Web Service.  Towards the end of the Maven build output, you should see the following if the execution is successful:

        ===============================================
        URL: http://helloworldrs-YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME.rhcloud.com/rest/xml
        MediaType: application/xml

        *** Response from Server ***

        <xml><result>Hello World!</result></xml>

        ===============================================
        ===============================================
        URL: http://helloworldrs-YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME.rhcloud.com/rest/json
        MediaType: application/json

        *** Response from Server ***

        {"result":"Hello World!"}

        ===============================================

When you are finished testing, restore the `pom.xml` file to the previous version if you want to test locally.

### Delete the OpenShift Application

When you are finished with the application you can delete it from OpenShift as follows:

        rhc app-delete -a helloworldrs

_Note_: There is a limit to the number of applications you can deploy concurrently to OpenShift. If the `rhc app create` command returns an error indicating you have reached that limit, you must delete an existing application before you continue. 

* To view the list of your OpenShift applications, type: `rhc domain show`
* To delete an application from OpenShift, type the following, substituting the application name you want to delete: `rhc app-delete -a APPLICATION_NAME_TO_DELETE`
