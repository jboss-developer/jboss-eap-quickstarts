	<title>Generating a basic Java EE web-application</title>
	<para>
      For the most part, people interested in Forge are likely interested in creating
      web-applications. Thusly, this chapter will overview the basic steps to generate
      such an application using Forge.

      <title>First steps with Scaffolding</title>
      <para>
         Assuming you have already completed the steps to <link linkend="forge.installation">
         install Forge</link>, the first thing you'll need to do is download and install 
         <ulink url="http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/downloads.html">JBoss Application 
         Server 6.0 or 7.0</ulink>. This server will host your application once it is built.
      </para>

         Next, follow these steps to create your skeleton web-application; be sure to
         replace any {ARGS} with your own personal values. Also keep in mind that while
         typing commands, you may press &lt;TAB&gt; at any time to see command
         completion options:
      
         <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
            	Execute <literal>'forge'</literal> from a command prompt.
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
               Create a new project:
               <programlisting>$ new-project --named {name} --topLevelPackage {com.package} --projectFolder {/directory/path}</programlisting>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
               Set up scaffolding, and press ENTER to confirm 
               installation of any required facet dependencies and/or packaging types:
               <programlisting>$ scaffold setup </programlisting>
               Then set up default index files, a default template and home-page. This creates the page
               that users will first see when accessing your application.
               <programlisting>$ scaffold create-indexes</programlisting>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
               Set up persistence (JPA), and press ENTER to confirm 
               installation of any required facet dependencies and/or packaging types,
               and remember to press TAB if you are not sure what comes next.
               <programlisting>$ persistence setup --provider {your JPA implementation} --container {your container}</programlisting>
               If you do not wish to use a Java EE container default data-source, you can also specify additional connection parameters 
               such as JNDI data-source names, JDBC connection information, and data-source types. Note, however, that this
               means you will probably need configure your application server to provide this new data-source and/or database connection.
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
               Create some JPA entities:
               <programlisting>$ new-entity --named Customer</programlisting>
               At which point Forge should automatically pick-up the newly created entity, and will be ready to add fields.
               <programlisting>Customer.java $ new-field string --named firstName
Customer.java $ new-field string --named lastName</programlisting>
               You may inspect the entity using 'ls'.
               <programlisting>Customer.java $ ls

[fields]
private::String::firstName;       private::String::lastName;
private::int::version;               private::long::id;

[methods]
public::getFirstName()::String                                               public::getId()::long
public::getLastName()::String                                                public::getVersion()::int
public::setFirstName(final String firstName)::void                    public::setId(final long id)::void
public::setLastName(final String lastName)::void                     public::setVersion(final int version)::void
public::toString()::String                                                          

Customer.java $</programlisting>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
               Once you have created fields in the entity, it's time to generate some scaffolding.
               For now, use the Forge default scaffold; you'll also need to confirm installation of a few libraries/dependencies.
               <programlisting>Customer.java $ scaffold from-entity 
               
No scaffold type was provided, use Forge default? [Y/n]

               That's it! Now build your project and deploy it onto 
               your JBoss Application Server instance:
               
               <programlisting>$ build</programlisting>
               
               If you have installed <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">Apache Maven 3.0+</ulink>,
               and set your JBOSS_HOME environment variable to the location of your JBOSS server installation folder,
               you can also build and deploy your application with the following commands.
            
               <programlisting>$ mvn clean package
$ mvn jboss:hard-deploy
$ mvn jboss:start</programlisting>

               Your project can correspondingly be undeployed using:
               
               <programlisting>$ mvn jboss:hard-undeploy
$ mvn jboss:stop</programlisting>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
               Access your application at: <literal>http://localhost:8080/{name}-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/</literal>
