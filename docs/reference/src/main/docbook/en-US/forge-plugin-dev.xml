	<title>Developing a Plugin</title>
	<para>
      Part of Forge's architecture is to allow extensions to be created with extreme 
      ease. This is done using the same programming model that you would use for any 
      CDI or Java EE application, and you should quickly recognize the annotation-driven
      patterns and practices applied.
   </para>
   <para>
      A Forge plugin could be as simple as a tool to print files to the console, or
      as complex as deploying an application to a server, 'tweet'ing the status of your
      latest source-code commit, or even sending commands to a home-automation system; 
      the sky is the limit!
   </para>

   <section id="plugin.dev.maven">
      <title>Referencing the Forge APIs</title>
      <para>
         Because Forge is based on Maven, the easiest way to get started quickly writing
         a plugin is to create a new maven Java project. This can be done by hand, or
         using Forge's build in plugin project facet.

         <title>Using Forge</title>
         <para>
            In two short steps, you can have a new plugin-project up and running; this
            can be done using Forge itself!

            If you do not wish to create a new plugin project using Forge itself, you
            will need to manually include the Forge-API dependencies. For purposes of
            simplicity, we have pasted a sample Maven POM file which can
            be used as a starting point for a new plugin:
         </para>
         <para>
	         NOTE: You must also create a <literal>beans.xml</literal> file in the

	         project, or your plugin will not be detected by Forge.

      <title>Implementing the Plugin interface</title>
      <para>
      	The first thing you must do in order to create a forge plugin, is create a new class
      	and implement the <literal>org.jboss.seam.forge.shell.plugins.Plugin</literal> interface.
      	Notice that the interface has no methods, this is because you will be adding your own
      	custom commands later.
         <programlisting>import org.jboss.seam.forge.shell.plugins.Plugin;
         
public class ExamplePlugin implements Plugin {
}</programlisting>
      </para>
   </section>
   
   <section id="plugin.dev.naming">
      <title>Naming your plugin</title>
      Each plugin should be given a name. This is done by adding the 
      <literal>@org.jboss.seam.forge.shell.plugins.Alias</literal> annotation to your plugin class.
      
      By default, if no <literal>@Alias</literal> annotation is found, the 
      lower-case Class name will be used; for instance, our <literal>ExamplePlugin</literal>,
      above, would be executed by typing:
      
      <programlisting>$ exampleplugin </programlisting>
      
      Now we will add a name to our plugin.
      <programlisting>@Alias("example")
public class ExamplePlugin implements Plugin {
   // commands
}</programlisting>
               
      Our named <literal>@Alias("example") ExamplePlugin</literal> would be executed by typing:
      <programlisting>$ example </programlisting>
   </section>
   
   <section id="plugin.dev.commands">
      <title>Add commands to your plugin</title>
      <para>
         Now that you have implemented the <literal>Plugin</literal> interface, it's time
         to add some functionality. This is done by adding "Commands" to your plugin class.
         Commands are plain Java methods in your plugin Class. Plugin methods must be annotated
         as either a <literal>@DefaultCommand</literal>, the method to be invoked if the plugin
         is called by name (with no additional commands), or <literal>@Command(name="...")</literal>,
         in which case the plugin name and command name must both be used to invoke the method.
      </para>
      <para>
         Commands also accept <literal>@Options</literal> parameters as arguments. These are
         <link linkend="plugins.dev.options">described in detail</link> later in this section.
      </para>
      
      <section id="plugin.dev.commands.default">
         <title>Default commands</title>
         <para>
            Default commands must be annotated with <literal>@DefaultCommand</literal>, and are
            not named; you may still provide help text or command metadata. Each
            plugin may have only one <literal>@DefaultCommand</literal>.
         </para>
         <para>
            The following default command would be executed by executing the plugin by its name:
            
            <programlisting>public class ExamplePlugin implements Plugin {
   @DefaultCommand
   public void exampleDefaultCommand( @Option String opt ) {
      // this method will be invoked, and 'opt' will be passed from the command line
   }
}</programlisting>
            <programlisting>$ exampleplugin some-input</programlisting>
            In this case, the value of '<literal>opt</literal>' will be "some-input".
            <literal>@Options</literal> are <link linkend="plugin.dev.options">described
            in detail</link> later in this section.
        </para>
      </section>
      
      <section id="plugin.dev.commands.named">
         <title>Named commands</title>
         <para>
            Named commands must, to little surprise, be given a name with which they are
            invoked. This is done by placing the <literal>@Command(name="...")</literal> annotation
            on a public Java method in your <literal>Plugin</literal> class.
         </para>
         <para>
            The following command would be executed by executing the plugin by its name,
            followed by the name of the command:
         
            <programlisting>public class ExamplePlugin implements Plugin {
   @Command(name="perform")
   public void exampleCommand( @Option(required=false) String opt, PipeOut out) {
       out.println(">> the command \"perform\" was invoked with the value: " + opt);
   }
}</programlisting>
            <programlisting>$ exampleplugin perform
>> the command "perform" was invoked with the value: null</programlisting>
         </para>
         <para>
            Notice that our command method has a parameter called "<literal>PipeOut</literal>,"
            in addition to our 'opt' parameter. <literal>PipeOut</literal> is a special 
            parameter, which can be placed in any order. It provides access to a
            variety of shell output functions, including enabling color and controlling 
            piping between plugins.
         </para>
         <para>
            Along with <literal>PipeOut</literal>, there is also a 
            <literal>@PipeIn InputStream stream</literal> annotation,
            which is used to inject a piped input stream (output from another
            Plugin's <literal>PipeOut</literal>.) These concepts will be described more in the
            section on <link linkend="plugin.dev.piping">piping</link>, but for now, you
            should just know that <literal>PipeOut</literal> is used to write output
            to the Forge console.

   <section id="plugin.dev.options">
      <title>Understanding command @Options</title>

      <para>
         Once we have a command or two in our Plugin, it's time to give our users some
         control over what it does; to do this, we use <literal>@Option</literal> params;
         options enable users to pass information of various types into our commands.
      </para>
      <para>
         Options can be named, in which case they are set by passing the
         <literal>--name</literal> followed immediately by the value, or if the option
         is a boolean flag, simply passing the flag will signal a `true` value.
         
         Named parameters may be passed into a command in any order, while unnamed 
         parameters must be passed into the command in the order with which
         they were defined.
      </para>
      
      <section id="plugin.dev.options.named">
         <title>--named options</title>
      
         <para>
            As mentioned above, options can be given both a long-name and/or a 
            short-name.  in which case, they would be defined like this:
            
            <programlisting>@Option(name="one", shortName="o")</programlisting>
            
            Short named parameters are called using a single dash '-' followed by
            the letter assigned '-o'; whereas long-named parameters are called using 
            a double dash '--' immediately followed by the name '--one'. )
         </para>
         <para>
            For example, the following command accepts several options, named 'one', 
            and 'two':
            
            <programlisting>public class ExamplePlugin implements Plugin {
   @Command(name="perform")
   public void exampleCommand( 
                  @Option(name="one", shortName="o") String one,
                  @Option(name="two") String two,
                  PipeOut out) {
       out.println(">> option one equals: " + one);
       out.println(">> option two equals: " + two);
   }
}</programlisting>
   
            The above command, when executed, would produce the following output:
         
            <programlisting>$ example-plugin perform --one cat --two dog 
>> option one equals: cat
>> option two equals: dog</programlisting>
         </para>
         <para>
            <tip>
               Named parameters can be called in any order. Notice that we could have also 
               called the command with options 'one' and 'two' in reverse order, or 
               by using their short names. These commands are equivalent:
               <programlisting>$ example-plugin perform --one cat --two dog
$ example-plugin perform --two dog --one cat
$ example-plugin perform --two dog -o cat</programlisting>
            </tip>

      <section id="plugin.dev.options.ordered">
         <title>Ordered options</title>

            In addition to <literal>--named</literal> option parameters, as described
            <link linkend="plugin.dev.options.named">above</link>, parameters may also
            be passed on the command line by the order in which they are entered. These
            are called "ordered option parameters", and do not require any parameters
            other than help or description information.

         </para>
         <para>
            For example, the following command accepts several options, named 'one',

                  @Option String three,
                  @Option String four,

       out.println(">> option one equals: " + one);
       out.println(">> option two equals: " + two);

            However, we could also achieve the same result by re-arranging parameters,

   <section id="plugin.dev.piping">
      <title>Piping output between plugins</title>
      
      <para>
         Much like a standard UNIX-style shell, the Forge shell supports piping IO between
         executables; however in the case of forge, piping actually occurs between plugins,
         commands, for example:
      </para>
      
      <programlisting>$ cat /home/username/.forge/config | grep automatic 
@/* Automatically generated config file */;</programlisting>

      <para>
         This might look like a typical BASH command, but if you run forge and try it,
         you may be surprised to find that the results are the same as on your system
         command prompt, and in this example, we are demonstrating the pipe: '|'
      </para>      

      <para>
         In order to enable piping in your plugins, you must use one or both of the
         <literal>@PipeIn InputStream stream</literal> or <literal>PipeOut out</literal>
         command arguments. Notice that <literal>PipeOut</literal> is a java type that 
         must be used as a Method parameter, whereas <literal>@PipeIn</literal> is 
         an annotation that must be placed on a Java <literal>@PipeIn InputStream 
         stream</literal> or <literal>@PipeIn String in</literal> Method parameter.
      </para>
      
      <para>
         `<literal>PipeOut out</literal>` - by default - is used to print output to 
         the shell console; however, if the plugin on the left-hand-side is piped to 
         a secondary plugin on the command line, the output will be written to the
         `<literal>@PipeIn InputStream stream</literal>` of the plugin on the 
         right-hand-side:
         
         <programlisting>$ left | right</programlisting>
         
         Or in terms of pipes, this could be thought of as a flow of data from left
         to right:
         
         <programlisting>$ PipeOut out -> @PipeIn InputStream stream</programlisting>
         
         Notice that you can pipe output between any number of plugins as long as each
         uses both a <literal>@PipeIn InputStream</literal> and <literal>PipeOut</literal>:
         
         <programlisting>$ first command | second command | third command</programlisting>
      </para>
      
      <example>
      	<title>@PipeIn InputStream stream</title>
      	<programlisting>
   @Command("example-command")
   public void exampleCommand(
            @PipeIn final InputStream in,
            @Option(required = false) final boolean option,
            PipeOut out)

         If your Plugin depends on classes or libraries that are not provided by Forge,

	      It it also recommended, however, to relocate shaded class files to a new package.
	      Your code will access the bundled code at this new location, and will prevent version
	      conflicts if another plugin bundles a different version of the same library. For this,
	      we use the following command.
	      <programlisting>$ shade relocate --pattern {ORIGINAL PGK} --shadedPattern {NEW PKG} --excludes {EXCLUDED PKGS...}</programlisting>
