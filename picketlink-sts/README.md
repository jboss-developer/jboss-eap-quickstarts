picketlink-sts: PicketLink Federation: WS-Trust Security Token Service 
======================================================
Author: Peter Skopek  
Level: Advanced  
Technologies: WS-Trust, SAML  
Summary: This project is an implementation of a WS-Trust Security Token Service.  
Target Product: EAP  
Product Versions: EAP 6.1, EAP 6.2  
Source: <https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/>  
 
What is it?
-----------

This example demonstrates how to deploy a fully compliant WS-Trust Security Token Service (STS).

WS-Trust extends the WS-Security specification to allow the issuance, renewal, and validation of security tokens. 
Many WS-Trust functions center around the use of a "Security Token Service", or STS. 
The STS is contacted to obtain security tokens that are used to create messages to talk to the services. 
The primary use of the STS is to acquire SAML tokens used to talk to the service.
The STS also plays an important role when you need to propagate credentials between different layers, for example, the web and service layer.

PicketLink also supports different token providers, which means you can provide your own custom security tokens.

_Note:_ This quickstart is not a fully functional application. It is a JAX-WS Endpoint based on PicketLink's WS-Trust implementation, which by default, allows you to issue, renew and validate SAML assertions. It is a service intended to be called by other applications. 


How to use this quickstart
-----------------------------

This quickstart is preconfigured to use the "picketlink-sts" security domain. By default, the STS is protected to only allow requests from authenticated users. All users and also their roles, are defined in two properties files:

        Users: src/main/resources/users.properties
        Roles: src/main/resources/roles.properties

You can view the WSDL for the STS at the following URL: <http://localhost:8080/picketlink-sts?wsdl>.

From a JAX-WS perspective, you can use any tool you want to start using the STS. Below is an example of a SOAP envelope asking the STS to issue a SAML v2.0 Assertion:

        <soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope" xmlns:urn="urn:picketlink:identity-federation:sts">
            <soap:Header/>
            <soap:Body>
                <wst:RequestSecurityToken xmlns:wst="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-trust/200512">
                    <wst:TokenType>http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/oasis-wss-saml-token-profile-1.1#SAMLV2.0</wst:TokenType>
                    <wst:RequestType>http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-trust/200512/Issue</wst:RequestType>
                </wst:RequestSecurityToken>
            </soap:Body>
        </soap:Envelope>

There is a simple example of WS-Trust client usage provided by PicketLink. To use this example deploy PicketLink STS as described below and run the `mvn exec:java` command. The assertion from PicketLink STS is printed to the console. This process is described in detail below in the section entitled "Access the Application".

_Note: This example is not suitable for production use. You must change the application security to comply with your organization's standards._

System requirements
-------------------

The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1 or later.

All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or later, Maven 3.0 or later.


Configure Maven
---------------

If you have not yet done so, you must [Configure Maven](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) before testing the quickstarts.


Configure the JBoss EAP Server
-------------------------------------------------

You configure the security domain by running JBoss CLI commands. For your convenience, this quickstart batches the commands into a `configure-security-domain.cli` script provided in the root directory of this quickstart. 

1. Before you begin, back up your server configuration file
    * If it is running, stop the JBoss EAP server.
    * Backup the file: `JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`
    * After you have completed testing this quickstart, you can replace this file to restore the server to its original configuration.

2. Start the JBoss EAP server by typing the following:

        For Linux:  JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows:  JBOSS_HOME\bin\standalone.bat
3. Review the `configure-security-domain.cli` file in the root of this quickstart directory. This script adds the `picketlink-sts` security domain to the `security` subsystem in the server configuration and configures authentication access.

4. Open a new command prompt, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command, replacing JBOSS_HOME with the path to your server:

        For Linux: JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=configure-security-domain.cli 
        For Windows: JBOSS_HOME\bin\jboss-cli.bat --connect --file=configure-security-domain.cli 

   If you are running the controller on different host, pass the following argument, replacing HOST_NAME and PORT_NUMBER with the correct values:

        --controller=HOST_NAME:PORT_NUMBER
   You should see the following result when you run the script:
   
        The batch executed successfully
        {"outcome" => "success"}

   The batch file also restarts the server.
   
Review the Modified Server Configuration
-----------------------------------

If you want to review and understand newly added XML configuration, stop the JBoss EAP server and open the  `JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file. 

The following `picketlink-sts` security-domain was added to the `security` subsystem.
   
   
        <security-domain name="picketlink-sts">
            <authentication>
                <login-module code="UsersRoles " flag="required">
                    <module-option name="usersProperties" value="users.properties"/>
                    <module-option name="rolesProperties" value="roles.properties"/>
                </login-module>
            </authentication>
        </security-domain>

Start the JBoss EAP Server
-------------------------

If you do not have a running server:

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the JBoss EAP directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server:

        For Linux:   JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows: JBOSS_HOME\bin\standalone.bat


Build and Deploy the Quickstart
-------------------------------

_NOTE: The following build command assumes you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line. See [Build and Deploy the Quickstarts](../README.md#build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) for complete instructions and additional options._

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:

        mvn clean install jboss-as:deploy
4. This deploys `target/jboss-picketlink-sts.war` to the running instance of the server.


Review the Modified Server Configuration
-----------------------------------

If you want to review and understand newly added XML configuration, stop the JBoss EAP server and open the  `JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file. 

Access the Application 
---------------------

You can test the service as follows:

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
2. Type the following command:

        mvn exec:java
3. You should see a `<saml:Assertion` assertion from PicketLink STS along with a `BUILD SUCCESS` printed to the console.

Undeploy and Remove the Security Domain Configuration
----------------------------------------

### Undeploy and Remove the Security Domain Using the JBoss CLI 

You can undeploy the quickstart and remove the security domain configuration in one easy step using the `undeploy-and-remove-security-domain.cli` script located in the root directory of this quickstart.

1. Open a new command prompt, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
2. Run the following command, replacing JBOSS_HOME with the path to your server:

        For Linux: JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --file=undeploy-and-remove-security-domain.cli
        For Windows: JBOSS_HOME\bin\jboss-cli.bat --file=undeploy-and-remove-security-domain.cli
   You should see the following result when you run the script:
   
        The batch executed successfully
        {"outcome" => "success"}

### Undeploy the quickstart and Remove the Security Domain Manually


1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:

        mvn jboss-as:undeploy
4. Stop the JBoss EAP server.
5. Replace the `JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file with the back-up copy of the file.


Run the Quickstart in JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse
-------------------------------------
You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For more information, see [Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_JDBS.md#use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts) 


Debug the Application
------------------------------------

If you want to debug the source code or look at the Javadocs of any library in the project, run either of the following commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect them.

      mvn dependency:sources
      mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc
