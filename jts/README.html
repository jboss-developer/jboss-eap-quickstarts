<h1>jts (Java Transaction Service): Distributed EJB Transactions Across Multiple Containers</h1>
<p>Author: Tom Jenkinson</p>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>This example demonstrates how to perform distributed transactions in an application. A 
distributed transaction is a set of operations performed by two or more nodes 
participating in an activity coordinated as a single entity of work and fulfilling
the properties of an ACID transaction. ACID meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atomic</li>
<li>Consistent</li>
<li>Isolated</li>
<li>Durable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The example uses Java Transaction Service (JTS) to propagate a transaction context across 
two Container-Managed Transaction (CMT) EJBs that, although deployed in separate servers,
participate in the same transaction. In this example, one server processes the 
Customer and Account data and the other server processes the Invoice data.</p>
<p>The example expects the EJBs to be deployed onto the same physical machine. This is not a 
restriction of JTS and the example can easily be converted to run on separate machines by 
editing the hostname value for the InvoiceManagerEJB in org.jboss.as.quickstarts.cmt.jts.ejb.AccountManagerEJB.</p>
<p>The example builds upon the CMT example also available in the quickstarts. </p>
<p>Again, a simple MDB has been provided that prints out the messages sent but this is not a 
transactional MDB and is purely provided for debugging purposes.</p>
<p>You will see that the AccountManagerEJB uses the EJB home for the remote EJB, this is expected
to connect to remote EJBs and could be simplified if the EJB was deployed locally.</p>
<h2>System requirements</h2>
<p>All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or better, Maven 3.0 or better.</p>
<p>The application this project produces is designed to be run on a JBoss AS 7 or JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6. 
The following instructions target JBoss AS 7, but they also apply to JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.</p>
<h2>Testing the application</h2>
<p>NOTE: Due to a difference in configuration between JBoss AS 7 and JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6, all references of standalone-full.xml
apply to JBoss AS 7 only, you can replace these references with standalone.xml if deploying into JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.</p>
<p>For this example, you will need two instances of the application server, with a subtle startup 
configuration difference. Application server 2 must be started up with a port offset provided
to the startup script as "-Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100"</p>
<p>The application servers 1 should both be configured as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the file <APP_SERVER_1_HOME>/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml</li>
<li>Enable JTS:
    Find the orb subsystem and change the configuration to:
        <subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:jacorb:1.1">
            <orb>
                <initializers security="on" transactions="on"/>
            </orb>
        </subsystem>
    Find the transaction subsystem and append the <jts/> element:
        <subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:transactions:1.1">
            <!-- LEAVE EXISTING CONFIG AND APPEND THE FOLLOWING -->
            <jts/>
        </subsystem></li>
</ol>
<p>To start JBoss AS 7 (or JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6) with a JMS connection factory and a queue named test queue in it. The instructions
for this vary slightly depending upon whether you are using the community release (JBoss AS 7) or the platform release (JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6)</p>
<p>For JBoss AS 7:</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;APP_SERVER_1_HOME&gt;/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
    &lt;APP_SERVER_2_HOME&gt;/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100
</code></pre>
<p>or if you are using windows</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;APP_SERVER_1_HOME&gt;\bin\standalone.bat -c standalone-full.xml
    &lt;APP_SERVER_2_HOME&gt;\bin\standalone.bat -c standalone-full.xml -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100
</code></pre>
<p>For JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6:</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;APP_SERVER_1_HOME&gt;/bin/standalone.sh
    &lt;APP_SERVER_2_HOME&gt;/bin/standalone.sh -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100
</code></pre>
<p>or if you are using windows</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;APP_SERVER_1_HOME&gt;\bin\standalone.bat
    &lt;APP_SERVER_2_HOME&gt;\bin\standalone.bat -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100
</code></pre>
<p>To deploy the application, you first need to produce the archives to deploy using
the following Maven goals. Note that application-component-2 must be built first as it provides an EJB client
to application-component-1. Also note that application-component-2 must be "installed"</p>
<pre><code>    cd &lt;JTS_QUICKSTART_HOME&gt;/application-component-2
    mvn install
    cd &lt;JTS_QUICKSTART_HOME&gt;/application-component-1
    mvn package
</code></pre>
<p>You can now deploy the artifact to the JBoss application server by executing the following command. Again, due to the way the 
application is written (with little failure detection), it is best to deploy application-component-2 first
so that when application-component-1 is deployed it can resolve the EJB from the other container: </p>
<pre><code>    cd &lt;JTS_QUICKSTART_HOME&gt;/application-component-2
    mvn jboss-as:deploy
    cd &lt;JTS_QUICKSTART_HOME&gt;/application-component-1
    mvn jboss-as:deploy
</code></pre>
<p>The application will now be running at the following URL <a href="http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-jts-application-component-1/">http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-jts-application-component-1/</a>.</p>
<p>When you enter a name and click to "invoice" that customer, you will see the following in the application server 1 console:
12:09:38,424 INFO  [org.jboss.ejb.client] (http-localhost-127.0.0.1-8080-1) JBoss EJB Client version 1.0.0.Beta11
12:09:38,513 ERROR [jacorb.orb] (http-localhost-127.0.0.1-8080-1) no adapter activator exists for jboss-as-jts-application-component-2&amp;%InvoiceManagerEJBImpl&amp;%home

<p>You will also see the following in application-server-2 console:
12:09:38,697 INFO  [org.jboss.ejb.client] (RequestProcessor-10) JBoss EJB Client version 1.0.0.Beta11

<p>The web page will change with a prompt for you to check the logs for the MDB messages in the server consoles above at which point you can be satisfied that the quickstart
has operated correctly.</p>
