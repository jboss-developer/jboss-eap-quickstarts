-- You can use this file to load seed data into the database using SQL statements
-- Since the database doesn't know to increase the Sequence to match what is manually loaded here it starts at 1 and tries
--  to enter a record with the same PK and create an error.  If we use a high we don't interfere with the sequencing (at least until later).
