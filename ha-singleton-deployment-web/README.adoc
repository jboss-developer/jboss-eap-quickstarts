[abstract]
The `ha-singleton-deployment` quickstart demonstrates the recommended way to deploy any service packaged in an application archive as a cluster-wide singleton.

== What is it?

The `ha-singleton-deployment` quickstart demonstrates the deployment of a service packaged in an application as a cluster-wide singleton using singleton deployments.
In this example, the service is a timer that is initialized by a `@Startup @Singleton` bean.
The example is built and packaged as a single Web archive.

For more information about singleton deployments, see _HA Singleton Deployments_ in the {LinkDevelopmentGuide}[__{DevelopmentBookName}__] for {DocInfoProductName} located on the Red Hat Customer Portal.

// Use of {jbossHomeName}_1 and {jbossHomeName}_2
include::../shared-doc/use-of-jboss-home-name.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Setting Up the Test Environment

To demonstrate the singleton behavior, at least two application server instances must be started.
Begin by making a copy of the entire {productName} directory to be used as second cluster member.
Note that the example can be run on a single node as well, but without observation of the singleton properties.

Start the two {productName} servers with the same HA profile using the following commands.
Note that a socket binding port offset and a unique node name must be passed to the second server if the servers are binding to the same host.

[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}_1__/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-ha.xml -Djboss.node.name=node1
$ __{jbossHomeName}_2__/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-ha.xml -Djboss.node.name=node2 -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100
----

NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}_1__\bin\standalone.bat` and `__{jbossHomeName}_2__\bin\standalone.bat` scripts.

This example is not limited to two servers. Additional servers can be started by specifying a unique port offset for each one.

== Running the Quickstart

. Start the {productName} servers as described in the above section.
. Navigate to the root directory of this quickstart in the terminal.
. Use the following command to clean up previously built artifacts, and build and deploy the EJB archive:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean install wildfly:deploy
----

. Ensure the `target/{artifactId}.war` archive is deployed to `node1` (the one without port offset) by observing the log.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----

The following warnings might appear in the server output after the applications are deployed. These warnings can be safely ignored in a development environment.

This might lead to performance problems. Please set your max receive buffer in the OS correctly (e.g. net.core.rmem_max on Linux)
----

. Use the following command to deploy the already built archive to the second server. Note that since the default socket binding port is `9990` and the second server has ports offsetted by `100`, the sum, `10090` must be passed as an argument to the deploy maven goal.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
mvn wildfly:deploy -Dwildfly.port=10090
----

. Ensure the `service/target/{artifactId}.jar` archive is deployed to `node2` by observing the log. Note that even though the logs indicate "Deployed", the deployment does not actually deploy completely and the timer is not operating on this node.

. Verify the timer is running only on one instance by observing the logs. The node running the timer will output the following every 5 seconds:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
INFO  [class org.jboss.as.quickstarts.ha.singleton.SingletonTimer] (EJB default - 1) SingletonTimer: Hello World!

While the instance not running, the timer will display the following as the last log line:

----

. Verify failover of the singleton deployment. Shutdown the server operating as the singleton master, for instance by using the `Ctrl` + `C` key combination in the terminal. Observe the following messages on the node being shutdown:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----

----
+
You might also see the following error in the singleton master log. This is due to the shutdown not finishing cleanly and is documented in https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBEAP-9408[JBEAP-9408]. You can ignore this error.

+
Now observe the log messages on the second server. The node will now be elected as the singleton master, deployment will complete, and the timer will start operating:

----

== Troubleshooting

Should the singleton be running on multiple nodes, the most common causes are accidentally starting with the `standalone.xml` or `standalone-full.xml` profile instead of with the `standalone-ha.xml` or `standalone-full-ha.xml` profile.
Make sure to start the server with an HA profile using `-c standalone-ha.xml`.

Another common cause is that the server instances did not discover each other and each server is operating as a singleton cluster. Ensure that multicast is enabled or change the `jgroups` subsystem configuration to use a different discovery mechanism.
Observe the following log line to ensure that the discovery was successful:

[source,options="nowrap"]

== Making Existing Deployments Singleton

In this quickstart, the deployment is made singleton by a configuration file bundled in the archive.
Inspect the content in `src/main/resources/META-INF/singleton-deployment.xml`.
Any existing deployment can be made singleton by using _deployment overlays_ mechanism.
To demonstrate how to use deployment overlays, follow these steps:

. Move the `src/main/resources/META-INF/singleton-deployment.xml` file into root directory of this quickstart.
. Rebuild the project. Ensure that the servers are started, and redeploy the application, which will no longer be configured by singleton deployment by the archive:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean install
$ mvn wildfly:deploy
$ mvn wildfly:deploy -Dwildfly.port=10090
----

. Start the management CLI and set up a deployment overlay on both servers. Make sure you use the port offset for the second server.
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}_1__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect
deployment-overlay add --name=singleton-deployment --deployments=ha-singleton-deployment.war --content=META-INF/singleton-deployment.xml=singleton-deployment.xml
deployment-overlay redeploy-affected --name=singleton-deployment
$ __{jbossHomeName}_2__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --controller=localhost:10090 deployment-overlay add --name=singleton-deployment --deployments=ha-singleton-deployment.war --content=META-INF/singleton-deployment.xml=singleton-deployment.xml deployment-overlay redeploy-affected --name=singleton-deployment
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the ` __{jbossHomeName}_1__\bin\jboss-cli.bat` and ` __{jbossHomeName}_2__\bin\jboss-cli.bat` scripts.

. Review the deployment overlay changes in the `standalone-ha.xml` server profile:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<deployment-overlays>
    <deployment-overlay name="singleton-deployment">
        <content path="META-INF/singleton-deployment.xml" content="60a35e2bb6a1886f0a4abe499c7af16833d2a533"/>
        <deployment name="ha-singleton-deployment.war"/>
    </deployment-overlay>
</deployment-overlays>
----

. Observe the server output. The deployments are now set up as singleton deployments.

. To remove the deployment overlay run the following CLI command:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
deployment-overlay remove --name=singleton-deployment
deployment-overlay redeploy-affected --name=singleton-deployment
----

For convenience, the management CLI scripts to add the deployment overlay, `singleton-deployment-overlay-add.cli`, and to remove the deployment overlay, `singleton-deployment-overlay-remove.cli`, are located in the root directory of this quickstart.

== Undeploy the Archives

. Ensure all {productName} servers are started.
. Navigate to the root directory of this quickstart in the terminal.
. Use the following commands to undeploy the artifacts:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn wildfly:undeploy
$ mvn wildfly:undeploy -Dwildfly.port=10090
