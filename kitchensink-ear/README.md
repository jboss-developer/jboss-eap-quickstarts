kitchensink-ear: Using Multiple Java EE 6 Technologies Deployed as an EAR
==============================================================================================
Author: Pete Muir  
Level: Intermediate  
Technologies: CDI, JSF, JPA, EJB, JAX-RS, BV, EAR  
Summary: The `kitchensink-ear` quickstart demonstrates web-enabled database application, using JSF, CDI, EJB, JPA and Bean Validation, packaged as an EAR.   
Target Product: JBoss EAP  
Source: <https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/>  

What is it?
-----------

The `kitchensink-ear` quickstart is a deployable Maven 3 project to help you get your foot in the door developing with Java EE 6 on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. 

It demonstrates how to create a compliant Java EE 6 application using JSF 2.1, CDI 1.0, JAX-RS, EJB 3.1, JPA 2.0 and Bean Validation 1.0. It includes a persistence unit and some sample persistence and transaction code to introduce you to database access in enterprise Java. It is based on the [kitchensink](../kitchensink/README.md) quickstart but is packaged as an EAR archive.

_Note: This quickstart uses the H2 database included with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6. It is a lightweight, relational example datasource that is used for examples only. It is not robust or scalable, is not supported, and should NOT be used in a production environment!_

_Note: This quickstart uses a `*-ds.xml` datasource configuration file for convenience and ease of database configuration. These files are deprecated in JBoss EAP 6.4 and should not be used in a production environment. Instead, you should configure the datasource using the Management CLI or Management Console. Datasource configuration is documented in the [Administration and Configuration Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/) for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform._


System requirements
-------------------

The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1 or later. 

All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or later, Maven 3.0 or later.

 
Configure Maven
---------------

If you have not yet done so, you must [Configure Maven](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) before testing the quickstarts.


Use of EAP_HOME
---------------

In the following instructions, replace `EAP_HOME` with the actual path to your JBoss EAP 6 installation. The installation path is described in detail here: [Use of EAP_HOME and JBOSS_HOME Variables](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_OF_EAP_HOME.md#use-of-eap_home-and-jboss_home-variables).


Start the JBoss EAP Server
-------------------------

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the JBoss EAP directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server:

        For Linux:   EAP_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows: EAP_HOME\bin\standalone.bat

 
Build and Deploy the Quickstart
-------------------------

_NOTE: The following build command assumes you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line. See [Build and Deploy the Quickstarts](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/BUILD_AND_DEPLOY.md#build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) for complete instructions and additional options._

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:

        mvn clean install jboss-as:deploy

4. This will deploy `target/jboss-kitchensink-ear.ear` to the running instance of the server.


Access the application 
---------------------

The application will be running at the following URL: <http://localhost:8080/jboss-kitchensink-ear-web>.

1. Enter a name, email address, and Phone nubmer in the input field and click the _Register_ button.
2. If the data entered is valid, the new member will be registered and added to the _Members_ display list.
3. If the data is not valid, you must fix the validation errors and try again.
4. When the registration is successful, you will see a log message in the server console:

        Registering _the_name_you_entered_


Undeploy the Archive
--------------------

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:

        mvn jboss-as:undeploy


Run the Arquillian Tests 
-------------------------

This quickstart provides Arquillian tests. By default, these tests are configured to be skipped as Arquillian tests require the use of a container. 

_NOTE: The following commands assume you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line. See [Run the Arquillian Tests](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/RUN_ARQUILLIAN_TESTS.md#run-the-arquillian-tests) for complete instructions and additional options._

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type the following command to run the test goal with the following profile activated:

        mvn clean test -Parq-jbossas-remote 


Investigate the Console Output
---------------------
You should see the following console output when you run the tests:

    Results :
    Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0


Investigate the Server Console Output
---------------------

Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse
-------------------------------------
You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a JBoss EAP server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see [Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_JBDS.md#use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts) 


Debug the Application
---------------------

If you want to debug the source code of any library in the project, run the following command to pull the source into your local repository. The IDE should then detect it.

        mvn dependency:sources
